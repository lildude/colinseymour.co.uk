<h3>About Me</h3>
<img itemprop="photo" class="alignleft" alt="Colin Seymour" src="/assets/photo.jpg" width="128" height="128" /><p>My name is Colin Seymour, Esq. and I was delivered to mum and dad, in Johannesburg, South Africa, on one fine summer day a long long time ago, by a great big african stork. Ok, the truth, many years ago, part of me (the Y chromosome part) won my very first race, all 3 inches of it.  It was a tough race as the odds were heavily stacked against me - probably in the region of about 80 million to 1, but I did it.  After winning that race, I spent about 9 months in this nice cosy cabin causing all sorts of havoc and decided enough was enough on my birthday and went for a walk - well more of a stumble at that time.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, I did a bit of schooling - 7 years at <span itemprop="alumniOf">Bordeaux Primary School</span>, 5 years at <span itemprop="alumniOf">Ferndale High School</span> - went to <a itemprop="alumniOf" href="http://www.wits.ac.za/" title="Wits University">Wits University</a> for a while and headed off to <a itemprop="" href="http://www.great-britain.co.uk/" title="Great Britain">greener pastures</a>.</p>
<p>I may now live in the UK, however I am still...</p>

<p>I'm a true hardcore techie and accordingly, I don't run Windows.  As a result, I develop my site to look good in <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> and Safari.  This is because I have easy access to these two browsers on Solaris/Linux/Mac OS X, and more importantly, because Firefox is Standards Compliant.  If you spot any problems when viewing with Internet Explorer, please take a screenshot and contact me. I'll try my best to correct things, but I can't guarantee it'll be in a timely manner.</p>

<h3>Standards</h3>
<p>I try my best to ensure that my site is as standards compliant as possible.  Unfortunately, that does mean sometimes things look horrible on browsers that do no comply with the required standards (Internet Explorer mainly), but I try to code round these when I find such a problem.</p>
