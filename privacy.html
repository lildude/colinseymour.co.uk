<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, ColinSeymour.co.uk collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. The purpose of collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use this website. From time to time, I may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>ColinSeymour.co.uk also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. ColinSeymour.co.uk does not use such information to identify its visitors and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to ColinSeymour.co.uk choose to interact with ColinSeymour.co.uk in ways that require ColinSeymour.co.uk to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that ColinSeymour.co.uk gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, visitors may choose to comment on an article and are asked to provide a name and email address. In each case, ColinSeymour.co.uk collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with ColinSeymour.co.uk. ColinSeymour.co.uk does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using ColinSeymour.co.uk, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. I, Colin Seymour, will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, I disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when I believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ColinSeymour.co.uk, third parties, or the public at large. If you send me a request, such as via the contact form on ColinSeymour.co.uk, I reserve the right to publish it in order to help clarify or respond to your request or to help support other users, unless you explicitly ask for the email to not be disclosed publicly. ColinSeymour.co.uk takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
