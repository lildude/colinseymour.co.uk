<p>If you're a Coldplay fan, you probably want to get your downloader ready PDQ.  Coldplay are releasing their next album - Left Right Left Right Left - to the masses as a <a href="http://www.coldplay.com/">free download</a> at 9am (UK time - <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?month=5&day=15&year=2009&hour=9&min=0&sec=0&p1=136">What time is that where I live?</a>) this morning.</p>

<p>Radiohead managed to get a UK #1 album by letting people pick their own price (including free).  I wonder how well Coldplay will do by taking that extra bit of thinking away from your and giving it away completely.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: It's 9:03 and as expected, the Coldplay site is crawling like a sleeping snail.</p>
