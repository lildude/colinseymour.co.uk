<p>I upgraded Wordpress to the latest release (<a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2006/03/security-202/">2.0.2</a>) today following a security alert, using my quick and nasty upgrade script. I'm starting to like this script - backup and upgrade in one quick easy step in about 40 seconds.</p>
