<p>The other day I discussed the possibility of a <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/half-bridge-half-tunnel">Half Bridge - Half Tunnel</a> to link England to France in lieu of a full on bridge.  Well, it appears I wasn't the only one to think of having a bridge as <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6517611.stm">proposals <em>were</em> actually put to the UK government in 1981</a>, but as you know, they were rejected. :-(</p>
