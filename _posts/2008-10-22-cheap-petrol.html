<p>I quite enjoyed filling up with petrol today.  I got to watch the litres of petrol enter my tank quicker than the Pounds left my wallet thanks to the lovely 97.9p a litre being charged by the Morrisons and Asda petrol stations in my area (<a href="http://www.petrolprices.com">petrolprices.com</a> told me)</p>
