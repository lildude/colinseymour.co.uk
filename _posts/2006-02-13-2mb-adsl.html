<p>Wooohooo, my fast internet access just got faster, and for less money too.  I'm with <a href="http://www.freedom2surf.net">F2S</a> and had a 512Kb unlimited connection, but only ever tipped over the 10Gb/month mark once in the 2 years I've had it. So I've  change to a 2Mb link with 10Gb/month cap (with uncapped between 1am and 6am). The new speed is fantastic!!!</p>
