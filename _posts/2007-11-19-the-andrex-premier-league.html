<p>I thought this was brilliant, and quite apt when I heard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Dallaglio">Lawrence Dallaglio</a> mention this on Top Gear last night:  Rugby players in the <a href="https://www.guinnesspremiership.com/">Guinness Premiership</a> refer to the <a href="https://www.premierleague.com">Barclays Premier Football League</a> as the Andrex Premier League - it's soft and unnecessarily expensive. Brilliant!!!</p>
