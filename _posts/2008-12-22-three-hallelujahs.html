<p><a class="thickbox" href="/img/3hals.png"><img src="/img/3hals-224x300.png" alt="Three Hallelujahs in One Chart" title="Three Hallelujahs in One Chart" width="224" height="300" class="alignright" /></a>Thanks to X-Factor, we've got 3 versions of the same song in the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chart/singles.shtml">top 40 singles chart</a> this week. I think this has got to be the first time in history.</p>
<p>This year's X-Factor was won by a girl named Alexandra Burke who I think sounds a bit like Leona Lewis. Anyway, the song she released as the "winner's song" is a cover of Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah", and as can be expected when X-Factor is involved, it charted at #1 this week and is officially the Christmas Number 1 for 2008.  </p>
<p>Now thanks to the beauty of the internet, and the fact the chart now takes into account downloads, the people's preference is really taken into account.  Thanks to X-Factor, Jeff Buckley's estate/family are in for a huge wadge of royalties thanks to it charting 2nd (<a href="https://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=AratTMGrHaQ">Jeff Buckley's version</a>) and Leonard Cohen can treat himself to a cigar or two as <a href="https://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=rf36v0epfmI">his version</a> charted at number 36 this week. Sadly, the version most listeners of the chart show would have heard - <a href="https://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=kB67HO8tkQs">Rufus Wainwright's cover</a> as used in Shrek, didn't make an appearance.</p>
