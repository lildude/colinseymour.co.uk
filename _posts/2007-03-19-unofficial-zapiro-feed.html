I'm a big fan of the <a href="https://www.madamandeve.co.za">Madam &amp; Eve</a> and Zapiro comics and do most of my regular web reading using feeds in Google Reader (if you don't have a feed, chances are I don't pop round very often).  Anyway, it wasn't long until I discovered that there wasn't a reliable M&amp;E feed and no Zapiro feed at all - so I created my own.</p>
<p><!--more--><br />
Going on <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/madam-eve-via-rss">two years ago</a>, I knocked up a script that scraped the Madam &amp; Eve site and pulled the cartoons into an RSS feed and started publishing it. So far, it's worked a treat and is gaining new subscribers all the time.</p>
<p>Several months ago I decided to do the same for the Zapiro cartoons published on the <a href="https://www.mg.co.za">Mail &amp; Guardian</a> website.  I've been testing this for quite some time and I haven't bumped into any issues yet, so I thought I'd share it with the world too.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of feeds and Zapiro, then subscribe away: <a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/UnofficialZapiro"><img style="vertical-align:bottom; border:0" src="/img/feed-icon-12x12.gif" alt="RSS Icon" title="Unofficial Feed for Daily Zapiro Cartoons" /></a></p>
<p>If you like Madam &amp; Eve too, then here's the feed for that too: <a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/MadamEve"><img style="vertical-align:bottom; border:0" src="/img/feed-icon-12x12.gif" alt="RSS Icon" title="Unofficial Feed for Daily Madam &amp; Eve Cartoons" /></a></p>
<p>All feeds I create are valid, where it's in my control, and use RSS 2.0 format.</p>
<div class="alert"><b>WARNING:</b> These are unofficial feeds and accordingly, I take no responsibility for their content.  If I have to remove a feed, I will update the feed to indicate it's removal, but I'm hoping I'll never have to do this.</div>
