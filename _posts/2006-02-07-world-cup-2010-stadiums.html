<p>The <a href="https://www.southafrica.info/2010/">2010 World Cup</a> stadiums in South Africa were <a href="https://www.southafrica.info/what_happening/sports/2010stadia070206.htm">announced</a> today.  5 current ones are going to be upgraded 3 others are going to be completely flattened and rebuilt, and 2 new stadiums are going to be built.  Sounds like a lot of work to do in 4 years, but I'm sure they'll all be complete.  The only other important thing to do by then is teach Bafana Bafana how score goals.  Yup, just concentrate on scoring goals, the wins will follow.  FYI, SA didn't qualify for this year's World Cup and didn't even score a single goal in the African Cup of Nations.</p>
