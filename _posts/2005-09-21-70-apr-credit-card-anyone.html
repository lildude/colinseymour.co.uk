<p>Is <a href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/credit-and-loans/article.html?in_article_id=403814&in_page_id=1">this</a> the most expensive credit card in the country? Vanquis Bank has launched a card charging a staggering 70% interest rate to the less well-off and those with credit problems. What a brilliant idea - lets screw the poor for even more money they don't have.</p>
