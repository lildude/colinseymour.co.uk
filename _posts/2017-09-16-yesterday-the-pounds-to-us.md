Yesterday the Â£ to US $ exchange rate soared to just over $1.36, a level higher than that at the time of the Brexit vote yet no one is blaming Brexit for its rise.  Unemployment is at record lows and Brexit isn't being blamed for it either. Wages and consumer spending are also increasing at a healthy rate and still no one is blaming Brexit. Why not? Because they all had nothing to do with Brexit and didn't in the first place.
