<p>As you can see, i've finally done it, I've updated my site and you are now looking at v2.0 of my website.  For posterity, I've taken a snapshot of what v1.0 looked like.</p>
<p>As part of the update I've updated the blogging backend code (now using <a href="https://www.wordpress.org" title="Wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>) and I've implemented a customised version of several of the plugins that available.</p>
