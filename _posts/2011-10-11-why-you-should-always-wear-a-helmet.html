<p>When I was a wee lad, my mum insisted I always wear a helmet when going out on my bicycle.  Many a time I argued, "forgot" and completely ignored my mum (it was a hideous looking thing - like a polystyrene bowl with a pair of knickers stretched over it to give it some colour), but eventually I reluctantly started wearing it, and now ALWAYS wear my helmet when out on my bike.</p>
<p>I was always under the impression my mum insisted I wear a helmet to protect my head in the event I was hit by a car, but as it turns out, it was to protect me from my own actions - a bit like a cork on the end of the fork.  My helmet has actually saved my head and face from my own actions on several occasion.  On one, I came off as I entered the driveway and flew into the gate.  I've got the scar on my shoulder but thanks to my helmet, I don't have a scar on my head to go with it. It also saved my face when I hit a pothole at about 40kph and severely broke my right wrist.  My face wouldn't be as beautiful as it is now had I not been wearing my road-buffer, I mean helmet on that day ;-) .</p>
<p>Now, I'm sure my mum heard many horror stories about what happens when you come off your bicycle without a helmet - she did work in a hospital for a long time - and I'm sure she pictured every one of them happening to me, but I bet she never imagined something like this happening to me...</p>

<p>I doubt Evan van der Spuy's (the guy clobbered by the red hatebees) mom imagined his helmet would come in handy in this event either.</p>
<p>So folks, this is why you must wear a helmet when riding your bicycle, and I don't care if you don't think you'll be getting any wild deer prancing through the streets of London.  You never know :-D</p>
