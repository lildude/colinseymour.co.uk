<p>If you've got a WAP phone, you're in luck... just because I'm working this weekend and felt kind of geeky, I added WAP support to my site. To keeps things quick and simple, it only shows the last 5 entries and their comments, but no images.</p>
<p>If you want to view my ramblings from your phone, point it to http://colinseymour.co.uk/wap/ and enjoy - oh and be sure to let me know of any problems if you stumble upon any.</p>
