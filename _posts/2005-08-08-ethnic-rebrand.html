<p>I know this is just going to annoy the hell out of mum - the UK may become a bit more like the Yanks with the possibility of an "<a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4130594.stm">ethnic rebrand</a>".  Yup, we may get hyphenated nationalities to describe the British, like Indian-British, Pakistani-British and African-British.  Now, should I start declaring my nationality as "African-British" or maybe "Just-British" or even "Sefrican-British"?</p>
