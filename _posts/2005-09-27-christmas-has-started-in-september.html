<p>Every year we say "I'm sure Christmas has started earlier this year". This must be a new record, it's not even October and Christmas has already started in the shops.  Most supermarkets are already selling chocolate box sets, Boots is starting with their 3 for 2 Christmas tat sale and House of Fraser is even selling Christmas decorations.</p>
