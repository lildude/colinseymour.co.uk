Well that didn't take long. A few weeks' ago I [mentioned](/46023) how useful it would be if airports could take advantage of FaceID tech to speed up the passport check, well here you go, the first world implementation of similar tech:

> Travellers departing from Dubai will no longer need to pass through any sort of security clearance counter or e-gate, they will simply walk through a virtual aquarium tunnel that will scan their face or iris using hidden cameras while they’re in motion.

It's for departing passengers only, but I think it's a good step in the right direction.
