<p>It's quite a bit later than last year, but Christmas is finally upon us.  The shops are starting to fill up with Christmas tat and the adverts have started on TV in a big way.  I wonder if the "<a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/blog/boom-economy-memorial/">economic downturn</a>" (read that as "the consequences of some super <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/blog/the-banking-world-is-crumbling/">greedy bankers</a> playing <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/blog/hedge-funds-bitten-by-their-own-greed/">silly buggers</a> with other people's money") has caused the shops to hold off a bit. Claire and I were discussing last night how there has been a definite break between Halloween/Guy Fawkes week and the big push on Crimbo advertising this year.</p>
<p>Anyway, only 5 more weeks of Crimbo shopping left, and if the current <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7736193.stm">talk about deflation</a> takes hold, you may just find it considerably cheaper to leave the shopping to the last minute, but do you have the balls?</p>
<p>So, get you padding on (you're not going to let those bargains slip by without a fight are you?), warm up the credit cards and get shopping.  And if you're not in the mood, try a bit of <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/blog/dominic-the-italian-christmas-donkey/">Dominic The Italian Christmas Donkey</a> to get you in the mood.</p>
