<p>South Africa is jumping head first into <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/10/26/south_africa_electronic_id/">electronic ID</a> cards to replace the aging ID books.  They plan on starting the transition in about 6 months time.  What's the bet the UK govt, if they approve ID cards, will wait to see how SA do it before implementing the same thing in the UK.</p>
