<p>Well, thus far getting rid of the plugins and relying purely on the built in functionality of Wordpress and the OCM plugin, no rubbish has got through, however I have got a couple of comments to moderate.</p>
<p>The next step in the spam fight is just simply refusing access from the spam site using a .htaccess file.  Ok, I've thought about this before, but wasn't too sure how I'd go about implementing it.  Then I spotted <a href="https://www.tomrafteryit.net/using-htaccess-to-minimise-comment-and-referrer-spam/">this</a> article.  Bingo, just what I was looking for, but alas someone commented on this blog with their <a href="https://micampe.it/2005/03/21/referrer-spammers-arent-a-life-form/">method</a>.  Seems even less complicated, and easier to maintain and even the author of the first article I found seems to have implemented this method.</p>
<p>I've now implemented this and will watch and see.  I haven't disabled the logging of the accesses just yet, so will still be able to see when things go wrong, which I hope they wont.</p>
