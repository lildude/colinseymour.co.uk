<p>This is unbelievable.  In a bid to get people buying more music, the music industry has come up with this &lt;sarcasm&gt;<em>brilliant</em>&lt;/sarcasm&gt; idea that the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSN0921673020070910">consumers want ringtones with their CD singles</a>. These will be marketed as "Ringles". </p>
<p>Erm, why on earth would l want to buy a CD AND a ringtone, which will cost more than a single alone and about 6 times as much as a legitimate download?  Most of the people they are aiming these "ringles" at (kiddies) have pretty advanced mobile phones which can play actual music files (MP3) for ringtones. Accordingly, they are not going to need the single AND the ringtone.</p>
<p>This isn't going to get kids buying CD singles again.  They're still going to pop over to their favourite music download site (legal and illegal), download a song, and copy it to their phones. </p>
<p>Maybe I'm missing something here, but I don't see how this is going to attract people back to buying CD singles. I can't remember the last time I bought a CD single, and this isn't going to change my mind either.</p>
