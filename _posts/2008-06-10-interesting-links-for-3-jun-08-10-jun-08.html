<p>Interesting links for 3 Jun 08 - 10 Jun 08:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90781/6422085.html">S Africa to launch battery car</a> - Oh the irony of it.  Whilst a great idea, it has one fundamental flaw: you charge it via the mains at night! Yup, right when Eskom shutdown the power cos they don't think you need it then.</li>
<li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7439182.stm">Free swimming to be 2012 legacy</a> - Somehow I don't think this will turn Britain into the next Australia in the Olympic pool, but it's a nice try. Hopefully this will include the indoor pools too and not just lidos.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pinktentacle.com/2008/06/robot-teddy-bear-car-navigation-system/">Robot teddy bear car navigation system</a> - I think this would be even cooler if they dressed the bear up to look like Super Ted</li>
<li><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2073117/Cyclists-allowed-wrong-way-up-one-way-streets.html">Cyclists allowed wrong way up one-way streets</a> - It's about time, but boy has this topic got motorists riles.  I'm a motorist AND a cyclist and I'm all for this change.  Everyone does it anyway.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1023674/The-2p-sausage-But-whats-Asdas-bargain-banger.html">Asda unveils the 2p sausage.</a> - These are probably the most revolting sausages you've ever tasted.  I'm NOT going to be trying these.  I like my sausages to be mostly meat, not filler.</li>
</ul>
