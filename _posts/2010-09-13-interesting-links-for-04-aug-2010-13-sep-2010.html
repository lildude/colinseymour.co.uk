<p>Interesting links for 04 Aug 2010 - 13 Sep 2010:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ur1.ca/101v7">Women attracted to men in red, research shows</a> - </li>
<li><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/06/urban-fox-hunt-chris-atkins">Urban fox hunt video was hoax aimed at the media, say film-makers</a> - It just goes to show that the UK media will believe and write and article about any sh*t they find on the internet, without actually checking facts, in a bid to make compelling "news".</li>
<li><a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/08/09/jetblue-attendant-goes-ballistic-on-flight-to-jfk/">Ballistic Ex-JetBlue Attendant Due In Court Tuesday</a> - What a way to quit your job.  A huge over-reaction, but it's surprising we haven't seen this before now.</li>
<li><a href="https://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Ryanairs-Michael-OLeary-Criticised-For-Plan-To-Replace-Co-Pilots-With-Air-Stewardesses/Article/201009115713986?f=rss">Ryanair's Michael O'Leary Criticised For Plan To Replace Co-Pilots With Air Stewardesses | UK News | Sky News</a> - Hmmmm, I don't think I like the idea of the lady who served me my extortionately priced drink and sandwich landing my plane too. And whilst this would save money right away, what's stopping the stewardesses taking the step up to becoming full pilots and demanding more money?</li>
<li><a href="https://supersport.com/rugby/super14/news/100913/Super_15_launched_in_Sydney">Super 15 launched in Sydney - SuperSport - Rugby</a> - Looks like next year's Super 15 (used to be 14) rugby is going to be pretty impressive and very exciting.  Maybe it's time I spent my gym membership on a Sky subscription.</li>
