<p>Now how's this for a cool idea: take tea and brew, serve, drink and create with it like you would coffee.  </p>

<p>This is exactly what some enterprising chap in Cape Town has done by creating (and patenting) the world's first tea espresso - <a href="http://www.redespresso.com/">Red Espresso</a>.</p>
<p>I'm quite a fan of rooibos tea, but alas, they don't seem to sell in the UK yet :-( .  Apparently it's available in the US, so I'll have to keep an eye out for it when we're over there.</p>
