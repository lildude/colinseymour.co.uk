<p>We've just got back from our second scan appointment and this one was way cooler and far more impressive than the <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/the-thin-blue-line">first scan</a>.  The baby is naturally much bigger and all it's little features are more defined and so much easier to see.  The amount of detail is unbelievable too; you can see the kidneys, bladder, the lips, facial profile (we're in for a hottie/handsome one ;-) ) and even the chambers of the heart. </p>
<p>It's truly amazing to watch this little being stretch, roll, wave, drink and dance around inside Claire's tummy (I might be <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/tiny-tumbles">partly to blame</a>), which brings us nicely onto the next part...</p>
<p><!--more-->The little one really was in the mood to be on TV - in a performing way, not a sit down and smile way.  For a start, it was breech which apparently makes some of the checks a bit harder. It was very very active and wouldn't stop performing for the camera long enough for the nurse to do all the checks and the little one is also a little on the small side for it's calculated age. As a result, we've got to go back for another scan in two weeks time to get the final tests completed and confirmation of the gender.</p>
<p>Until then, for your viewing pleasure, may I present two more photos of our little one, taken a few seconds apart...</p>
