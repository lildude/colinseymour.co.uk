<p>This Marmite advert has <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-23601215" target="_blank">drawn complaints</a> from a few sensitive souls...</p>
<div class="center"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/mHjssdNNzP0?rel=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
<p>I think it's a very clever advert and I especially like how they hide the dog's identity :-)</p>
