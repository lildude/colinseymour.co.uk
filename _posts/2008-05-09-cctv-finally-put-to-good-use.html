<p>This is just pure genius...  an unsigned band - The Get Out Clause - from Manchester couldn't afford a proper film crew to make their music video, so they came up with the ingenious plan of using the millions of CCTV cameras dotted around Manchester, and the Freedom on Information Act to their full advantage.</p>
<p>And this is the result...</p>

<p>What a great way to abuse CCTV cameras (<a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7384843.stm">which aren't much use anyway</a>) and the law to save yourself a load of cash.</p>
