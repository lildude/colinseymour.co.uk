<p>This is unbelievable... <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-17066798" target="_blank">a bus driver in Bristol was sentenced to 17 months in jail</a>, yes only 17 MONTHS for this lunacy...</p>

<p>Your eyes are not deceiving you.  The bus driver deliberately knocked the cyclist off his bike and has been sentenced to a mere 17 months with the ability to be considered for release on licence after only serving half this time.</p>
<p>I'm not a legal expert, but surely something as severe as this is tantamount to attempted manslaughter.  I know intent and state of mind (the driver admitted to having a "moment of madness") have something to do with deciding on the crime, but had the cyclist landed where his bike did - under the wheels of the bus - grievous bodily harm would have been the last thing on anyone's mind.  </p>
