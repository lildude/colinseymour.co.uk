<p>Today is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritage_Day_(South_Africa)">Heritage Day</a> in sunny South Africa. It's the day...</p>
<blockquote><p>when South Africans celebrate the diverse cultural heritage that makes up a "rainbow nation". It is the day to celebrate the contribution of all South Africans to the building of South Africa.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyway, Google had recognised it too with a pretty cool looking logo (the colours go so well)...</p>

<p>I think I should have pulled the South African card and taken today off too.</p>
