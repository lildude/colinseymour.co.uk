<p>I've just checked the cricket score for today's game between SA and England, and <a href="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/290687.html">quite fittingly</a>, KP has just been caught by Graeme Smith for 3.  He won't be too please about that (the score or who caught him).  Prior to his dismissal, there were 13 South African's (by birth) on the field and 0 Englishmen - KP & Strauss at the crease, the 11 SA fielders and neither of the umps are English either.  Watch out, we're slowly taking over the world.</p>
