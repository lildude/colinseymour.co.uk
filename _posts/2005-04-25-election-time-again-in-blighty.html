<p>As everyone probably knows, it's election time again in the UK and the 3 main political parties are doing their advertising.  Claire and I registered for postal voting this year as it's a bit of a shlep getting to a polling station after work (we don't get the day off like they do in SA). Well, our ballot papers arrived on Saturday morning.  I opened mine, had a squiz through the candidates and packed up laughing... there is an official party called "The Official Monster Raving Loony Party".  I couldn't believe it.  I've heard about the likes of the "Soccer Party" and other such parties, but never this one.  These guys even have a <a href="http://www.omrlp.com/">website</a> and a <a href="http://omrlp.brinkster.net/Manicfesto2005.asp">"manicfesto"</a> for these elections... check out their site and their manifesto, it's a good laugh. Oh and take note of where their HQ is (see bottom of their site)</p>
<p>Of course, anyone who's lived in the UK for some time will have heard of these guys - apparently they're well known for founder "Screaming Lord Sutch".  Well I'd never heard of these folks until Saturday, but I guess I learn something new everyday.</p>
