Just the other day (<a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-13189-1633211,00.html">The Times: 30 May 2005</a>) Shane Warne was calling for the likes of Bangladesh to be dropped from the list of teams playing competitive international Test cricket along with other countries who weren't quite living up to the term "competitive".</p>
<p>Well, Bangladesh may not be able to play Test cricket (the 5 day game), but they proved yesterday that they can't be ruled out of the one day game just yet.  They went on to a historic win yesterday by beating the world champions by 5 wickets (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/shared/fds/hi/statistics/cricket/scorecards/2005/6/11997/html/scorecard.stm">scorecard</a>).  I wouldn't call this a particularily close victory either... they still had 4 balls to play with too.</p>
<p>I think there's more cricket to come from Bangladesh, however we may have to wait a bit.</p>
