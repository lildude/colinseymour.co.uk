<p>Whilst flipping through channels one evening, I stumbled upon the <a href="http://www.tinthepark.com/" target="_blank">T in the Park</a> TV highlights coverage on BBC3.  I don't tend to watch these programmes for very long, but I do like to watch just long enough to get a good look at the flags flying in the crowd. Several years ago I noticed a South African flag in the audience for the first time and now look out for one in every festival I see on TV.</p>
<p>This time I didn't notice a South African flag, but I did notice one flag in particular...</p>

<p>Admittedly it was a bit hard to miss given it was the only flag in the audience and also flying right in the middle of the screen with my name on it.  </p>
<p>Claire says she didn't have anything to do with it, but I'm suspicious ;-)</p>
