<p>Interesting links for 24 May 2007 - 4 June 2007:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.scq.ubc.ca/the-social-norm-of-leaving-the-toilet-seat-down-a-game-theoretic-analysis/">The Social Norm of Leaving the Toilet Seat Down</a> - Some people have just far too much time.  What this doesn't address is who left it down in the first place.</li>
<li><a href="https://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2007/525/1">See Those Fingers? Do the Math</a> - Hey, my ring fingers are longer than my index fingers and I'm good at maths (well I was the last time I checked). Could this just be co-incidence?</li>
<li><a href="https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070530-apple-hides-account-info-in-drm-free-music-too.html">Apple hides account info in DRM-free music, too</a> - It won't be long before someone releases software to remove this.  I'd expect a simple hexeditor could change this info.</li>
<li><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6692593.stm">Alcohol Health Warnings by 2008</a> - I don't think this will make a blind bit of difference to the binge drinking in the UK; it'll just give people something else to brag about on a Monday morning. It also won't be much use considering most beer is drunk in pints not bottles.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-OpenCola">How to Make OpenCola</a> - Now you can make your own tooth decay in a can.</li>
</ul>
