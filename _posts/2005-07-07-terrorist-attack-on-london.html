<p>After yesterday's fantastic news about London winning the 2012 Olympic bid, who would have thought today would turn out like it did. It's a pity such a momentous occasion should be <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/europe/2004/madrid_train_attacks/default.stm">marred</a> by the actions of a small group of terrorists.  I suppose we can count ourselves lucky that the damage and casualties is no where near that of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/americas/2001/day_of_terror/">9/11 attack on New York</a>, or the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/europe/2004/madrid_train_attacks/default.stm">train bomb attack on Madrid </a> on 11 March 2004.  </p>
<p>I can't help but think there may be more to come... if these terrorists were set on causing a great amount of harm and chaos, you would have thought they'd target something more densely populated than a few underground stations and a bus. I'm not going to tempt fate with some possible targets, but I really hope nothing more comes from this, especially towards the Muslims of this country - I just know some very narrow minded people are going to take this all the wrong way and try and seek some sort of revenge.</p>
