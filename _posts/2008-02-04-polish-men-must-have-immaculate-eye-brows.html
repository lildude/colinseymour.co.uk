<p>I've found a good and affordable barber in Reading that appears to be run by two Polish ladies. In the 4 visits I've had, I've not had one bad hair cut, which is more than I can say for some of the more expensive 'trendier' barbers.  On each occasion they ask if I would like my side burns levelled (they tend to go a bit wonky from shaving), which is quite normal and expected, but they also ALWAYS ask if I'd my <em>eyebrows</em> trimmed. </p>
<p>This is the ONLY barber that has ever offered this, and they've offered it every time I've gone.  I know I have slightly bushy eyebrows - note eyebrow<strong>S</strong> (I don't have a mono-brow) - but I don't think they need pruning just yet.  Maybe one day when I'm an old man and can hardly see due to the large bushes above my eyes (<a href="https://homepages.tcp.co.uk/~jhdean/eyebrow.jpg">like this</a>), but not now.</p>
<p>I don't know about anyone else, but this offer always strikes me as a little odd.  Maybe it's what they do in Poland.</p>
