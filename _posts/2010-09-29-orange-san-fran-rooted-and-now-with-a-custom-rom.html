<p>I'm pleased to say I've just followed <a href="http://android.modaco.com/content/zte-blade-blade-modaco-com/318686/29-sep-r2-modaco-custom-rom-for-the-orange-san-francisco-install-video-now-online/" target="_blank">these incredibly simple instructions</a> and in about 10 minutes I've rooted my <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/orange-san-francisco-android-phone">Orange San Francisco Android phone</a> and installed a custom ROM too.  No more rubbish Orange apps and it's looking more like a normal Android phone.</p>
