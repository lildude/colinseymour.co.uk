<p>The God of squirrels will keep an eye out for me when the squirrels take over the world.  Today, I had the opportunity of continuing to drive at 30mph and turn a squirrel into a road rug, or brake and save his life.  I chose "brake". He took his paws off the top of his head, opened his eyes, smiled and ran off.</p>
