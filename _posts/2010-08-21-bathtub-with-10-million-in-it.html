<p>Ever have a dream of filling a bathtub with $10 million?  I have and have now done so so I can tick this off my list of things to do before I die...</p>

Well now you know." width="600" height="399" /></a><br />

<p>As you can see, it's not very impressive, and having a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Zimbabwe_$100_trillion_2009_Obverse.jpg" target="_blank">trillion Dollars</a> wouldn't have made it any more impressive.  Maybe it's because I used Zimbabwean Dollars :-) I added the ducks because the money was looking a little lonely on it's own at the bottom of the bath. </p>
<p>The note itself isn't much to look at with the crudest of anti-forgery "technology", but that isn't really surprising considering the note has an expiry date on it.  </p>

<p>Given Zimbabwe's astronomical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_dollar#Inflation" target="_blank">inflation rate</a> at the time  the note was issued - 66,212.3% in December 2007 which rocketed to 231,150,888.87%  in July 2008 - I'm surprised they even gave it 6 months.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm now an expired millionaire and wallowing in my wealth.  Not quite like <a href="https://www.chocolatemintsinajar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/scrooge-mcduck.jpg" target="_blank">Scrooge McDuck</a>, but near enough.  Thanks Mum for making me a millionaire.</p>
