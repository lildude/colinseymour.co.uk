<p>We've got a lot of trees at the back of our flat with an abundant supply of squirrels.  I think I need to setup a huge course like this for my local squirrels...</p>

<p>Once I've got them doing this, I'm sure I can then harness them for more useful purposes: mowing the lawn, washing my car, and then outsource them to the highest bidder in my quest for world domination.  Bwahahahahaha.</p>
