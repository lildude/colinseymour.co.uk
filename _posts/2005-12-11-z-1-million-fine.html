<p>You've really got to feel a bit sorry for Zimbabwe when Uncle Bob's govt thinks a Z$1 million <a href="http://www.fin24.co.za/articles/default/display_article.asp?Nav=ns&ArticleID=1518-25_1848814">fine</a> for violating foreign exchange regulations, is a tough fine. Before you all rush to <a href="http://www.xe.com/">xe.com</a>, that Z$1m is about US$13, â‚¬11 or Â£7.50 - yes, you read correctly, it's less than a tenner.  Hey, Mr Meman, give me a shout, I've got more than that in my wallet right now, I'll pay off your fine in the interests of promoting cricket.</p>
