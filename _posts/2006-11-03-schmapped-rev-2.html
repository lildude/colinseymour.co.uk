<p><img class="alignright" src="/img/SchmapLogo.png" alt="Schmap Logo" />Back in <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/ive-been-schmapped">June</a> I was informed that <a href="http://www.schmap.com/photos/p=24148533N00/c=SC100485">5 of my pictures</a> from our trip to Bath had been included in the Schmap Bath Guide.  Well today, I received an email telling me <a href="http://www.schmap.com/photos/p=24148533N00/c=SD1004232">4 of those pics</a> (<a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/gallery/album/bath-october-2005/photo/the-royal-crescent-5/">this one</a> got the chop) made the cut into <a href="http://www.schmap.com/guides/bath">rev 2 of the guide</a>.  Cool!</p>
