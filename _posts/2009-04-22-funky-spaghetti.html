<p>How's this for a great way of making kid's food entertaining with very little effort or fuss...</p>

<p>Just push some dried spaghetti through some sausages (eg viennas or franks, NOT bangers) before boiling and amaze your kids at the cooool funky dinner you've just made them.  Just think of all the creative food you could come up with using this method.</p>
