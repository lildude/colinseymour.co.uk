<p>Yup, this year contestants for Big Brother 7 are being selected purely by random just like Willy Wonka did it in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" by Roald Dahl.  Channel 4 is <a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/B/bigbrother/read.html">putting 100 golden tickets into Kitkat four-finger</a> single bars and Kit Kat Chunky single bars.  </p>
<p>Great, so now not only will be have crap TV for most of the summer, but also a house full of starstruck, emotionally-retarded, socially-inadequate, OBESE Kitkat munching TV wannabes. Sounds like fun to me :-/</p>
<p>Some enterprising individual is aready trying to <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/BIG-BROTHER-7-GOLD-TICKET-KIT-KAT_W0QQitemZ6629075643QQcategoryZ1306QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem">make money off it</a> (<a href="https://static.flickr.com/51/144612419_54a59c973a_o.jpg">Screenshot</a> saved for posterity.)  </p>
<p>Now why didn't I think of that?</p>
