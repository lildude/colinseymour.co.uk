<p>Those <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4778575.stm">bloody terrorists</a> are so damn inconsiderate. They could have at least waited until we were back from our holiday before getting rumbled; not a week before. I'm happy they've been busted and their plot foiled, but I've got better things to do next Saturday than sit around Heathrow Airport Terminal 2 for upteen hours holding onto a clear plastic bag containing my wallet and passport.</p>
<p>Hopefully they'll allow hand luggage again by then. If not, I wonder if I can ask for my bags at Paris CDG... I really don't want to sit bored out of my mind, watching some crap movie for the long haul to Jo'burg.</p>
