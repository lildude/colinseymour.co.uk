<p>Thursday night I wondered into the kitchen and happened to look out the window and I noticed this green light in the sky.  I instantly, and quite excitedly thought to myself "Could this be the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_%28astronomy%29" target="_blank">Aurora Borealis</a> very far down over the south of the UK or some other phenomenon that caused the green clouds?" </p>

<p>This green section of the sky was definitely in a northerly direction from us, though given it was quite cloudy I'm doubtful it was the Aurora Borealis, especially as <a href="http://www.dcs.lancs.ac.uk/iono/aurorawatch/" target="_blank">Aurora Watch</a> didn't report any activity. It was probably something more realistic like a flood lit stadium (I'm not aware of any in that direction close enough to light up the sky for us to see), some geological phenomenon (most likely) or a UFO ;-) .  I know the Aurora Borealis is meant to be visible a lot further south at times, but this far and with cloud cover?  I'm doubtful.  It was pretty none-the-less.</p>
<p>Anyone with any ideas?</p>
