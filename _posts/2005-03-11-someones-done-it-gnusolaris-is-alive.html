<p>I mentioned the other <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/gentooopensolaris-is-coming">day</a> about the pending release of <a href="https://www.opensolaris.org">OpenSolaris</a> and the news that Gentoo's portage will be ported to OpenSolaris.  Well, one of the guys at work has set the ball rolling with his implementation of <a href="https://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/eric_boutilier/20050301#wip">GNU/UNIX</a> using pkgsrc and the Solaris 10 core installation available for download from the Sun <a href="https://www.sun.com/solaris/">Solaris 10</a> website.</p>
<p>The idea is to get this working and documented now, and then when OpenSolaris is released, most of the leg work has been done and everyone can roll their own GNU/Solaris or GNU/UNIX system - Cool.  Hopefully Gentoo's Portaris will be up to speed then too.</p>
