<p>First it was the tooth fairy, then the Easter Bunny and finally Father Christmas; we all believed in them and then one at a time each was revealed to be a con (Hmmm, did this coincide with the bank of mum drying up for anyone else?).  Well, I'm sorry to do it, but I'm going to have reveal a con we've all grown up to believe...</p>

<p>Yup, you read that correctly (I'm sure the great big red letters helped :-) ). For over 20 years now <a href="https://www.duracell.com/landing.asp">Duracell</a>, in SA at least, have been claiming that their batteries last up to <q>6 times longer than normal ordinary zinc-carbon batteries</q>.  Well they can't anymore.  The Advertising Standards Authority in South Africa <a href="https://www.mweb.co.za//finance/?p=FinanceNewsArticle&i=360006">(ASA) has ruled that this claim is not accurate</a> following a referral by Everyready who used evidence from the South African Bureau of Standards (SABS). </p>
<p>How else did he manage to last for so long on all those adverts?</p>
<p>It's interesting to note that of all the Duracell websites, only the <a href="https://www.duracell.com/au/main/pages/">Australian website</a> has any sort of similar slogan, and even then this has a kind of get out clause.</p>
<p>Oh and another thing... I wonder how my website stats will fair now that I've got Viagra 3 times in one post.  If you've got here surfing for cheap blue pills - sorry to disappoint you.  Try Googling a bit better next time. :-D</p>
