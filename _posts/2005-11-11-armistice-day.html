<p>It's the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month - it must be time for 11'ses.  Nope, it's actually Armistic Day, or it was until World War II when it became known as Rememberance Day in the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>I know this is going to sound a bit farcical coming from me, but two minutes silence please.</p>
