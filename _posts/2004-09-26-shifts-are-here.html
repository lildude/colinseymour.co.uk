<p><strong><em>[Edited]</em></strong> Well, mum always askes when I'm on shifts, and what times and I can't always remember when I'm on shifts in the future when I'm not a work, so I've put my current shift rota <a href="/calendar/" title="Col's Work Calendar">here</a></p>
<p>I found an internal webpage that allows me to view my calendar, however this isn't publically available, so I created a script that uploads my calendar to this site everyday... oh and it also removes all "work confidential" stuff.</p>
<p>If I'm not working a shift, I'm working normal hours (9:00 - 17:30) or I'm on hols (it says Vacation cos I work for an American company).</p>
