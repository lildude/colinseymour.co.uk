<p>Heh heh heh.  I quite like the country side, and now I like it more :-)  The best comment of the whole <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/dorset/6901543.stm">article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We'll be doing some rain magic to bring the rain and wash it away.</p></blockquote>
<p>If it hadn't been raining so much recently, I'd like to have seen them perform their "magic".</p>
