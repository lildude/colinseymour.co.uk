<p>Everyone has heard the expression "<em>It's a small world we live in.</em>" Well, it couldn't be more true.  On Friday evening, I went to Claire's work Christmas bash and was seated at a table with Claire and some of her colleagues from her department. </p>
<p>Well, the topic soon changed to South Africa (I think it was a bounce off the line "<em>It's not going to snow in Africa this Christmas</em>" from the Band Aid song - more on that later.) One of Claire's colleagues, Carine, is from South Africa, so the conversion went along the usual lines of: "<em>Where in SA are you from?</em>", "Jo'burg", "<em>oh me too, where in Jo'burg?</em>", "Randburg", "<em>no way, me too, where in Randburg?</em>".  I'm sure you get the idea.  </p>
<p>Well, Carine is from Blairegowrie and went to Bordeaux Primary School and Randpark High School - what a small world... I went to Bordeaux Primary too, and my sister went to Randpark High.  One thing is for sure, our paths were not likely to have ever crossed prior to this as she is 9 years older than me, and has been in the UK for 12 years already.  So it just goes to show... even being 8000km away from home, you still meet people from your home town.  Now that's a small world.</p>
