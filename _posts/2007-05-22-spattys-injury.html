<p>The other day Spatty (my 17 year old moggy back home in SA) had a bit of an altercation with a rottie.  Thankfully she only came off with a couple of puncture wounds and a broken leg. Check the size of the cast...</p>

<p>I'd hate to see what the rottie looked like ;-).  </p>
<p>Mum's friend in the complex has kindly "adopted" Spatty, and Spatty seems to be settling nicely into dog free environment. She's a crazy picky moggy that hasn't been in the house for any reasonable amount of time since I left home and mum got <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/prezzie-for-george">George</a>.</p>
