<p>Looks like we're in for a stinking hot July.  The MET office has issued a <a href="https://www.met-office.gov.uk/weather/europe/uk/heat_health.html">heat wave warning</a> for the early part of this week. I couldn't help but over hear the news on the TV.  One of the stories went something along the lines of "Ministers to investigate heatwave".  Ermm, I can answer that - it's summer, things do get hot, especially with "global warming".</p>
