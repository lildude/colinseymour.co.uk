<p>Today is lieu day for me following working the weekend, so I thought I'd experiment a little for breakfast and raid the fridge and use up some of the left overs.   A little bit of creativity and about 10 mins and I'd created this for my breakfast...</p>

<p>I've called it "Paleo Eiers Rancheros" as it is sort of like huevo rancheros, just without the peppers, coriander and tortillas and with added bacon and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boerewors" target="_blank">boerewors</a>.  Eiers is the Afrikaans for eggs.  Actually, come to think of it, it's probably nothing like huevos rancheros. Oh well, it is in my mind, and now yours ;-) .</p>
<p>For those who like recipes, here's a recipe that serves one:</p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
<li>3 eggs</li>
<li>generous slosh of left over whipping cream, unwhipped</li>
<li>1 green chilli, deseeded and thinly sliced</li>
<li>2 inches of left over boerewors (wors), thinly sliced</li>
<li>2 rashes of left over back bacon, chopped</li>
<li>6 cherry tomatoes, quartered</li>
<li>Generous knob of butter</li>
</ul>
<h3>Method:</h3>
<p>Slice the bacon and boerewors and fry on a low heat with half of the butter.  You want to cook the bacon and warm up the wors.</p>
<p>Whilst the bacon and wors are slowly cooking and warming up respectively, quickly slice the green chilli, quarter the cherry tomatoes and lightly whisk the 3 eggs with the cream in a bowl.</p>
<p>Once the bacon is cooked and the wors piping hot, transfer it to a side plate.</p>
<p>Add the remaining butter to the pan and pour in the egg and cream mix and immediately start scrambling the eggs with a spatchula. When the eggs start to form scrambled eggs, toss in the chilli, tomatoes, bacon and wors and fold into the eggs.  Keep this up until the meat and veg are distributed evenly and the eggs are as you like them.</p>
<p>Serve wish a drizzle of chipotle chilli sauce and tuck in. Yum yum yum. :-P</p>
<p>And that folks is a quick, easy and incredibly tasty paleo breakfast for you - I think it's taken me longer to write this post than it took to actually make breakfast.  Sadly I don't have this every morning.  Most work mornings breakfast is fruit salad with a generous dollop of full fat greek yoghurt.</p>
