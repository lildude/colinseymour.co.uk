<p>Don't forget to hold back your cheers of "Happy New Year" by one second.  A leap second is being added tonight at exactly <a href="http://hpiers.obspm.fr/iers/bul/bulc/bulletinc.dat">23h 59m 60s</a> - ie you'll experience a 61st second.  Wikipedia has all the details you'd ever want to know about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second">leap seconds</a>.</p>
