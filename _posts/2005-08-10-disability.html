<p>I've discovered a new blog that I find worth reading - <a href="https://www.joblog.co.za">JoBlog</a> - it's by four guys who seem to live or work in and around the Fourways/Olivedale/Northgate area where I used to live. One of their <a href="https://www.joblog.co.za/2005/07/spar_isnt_stupi.html">posts</a> features this very informative image:</p>
<p><img class="centered" src="https://photos22.flickr.com/32836252_e9ec8f3186_o.jpg" alt="Stupidity is not a Disability" /></p>
<p>It's on the wall outside the Spar in the All Saints Shopping Centre diagonally opposite the Olivedale Hospital where mum works. I can confirm that this is still there.  Mum popped by this morning and confirmed it.</p>
<p>I think we could do with a lot more of these signs, along with big, bright yellow, high-tack (super sticky) stickers  like this:</p>
<p><img class="centered" src="https://photos22.flickr.com/32842565_bf7de41b65.jpg" alt="Inconsiderate Driver Sticker" /></p>
<p>These stickers can then be used to combat inconsiderate drivers who; park across two bays when one would be enough, park in disabled bays when not disabled, park in the middle of the road and any other inconsiderate motoring offence.</p>
