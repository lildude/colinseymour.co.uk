<p>If you've got a spare minute or two, check out the <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/en/bia/gallery.html">gallery</a> of images for the "<a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/en/bia/">Biomedical Image Awards 2006</a>".  It's amazing how cool teeny weeny little cells and nerves can look under the correct circumstances.</p>
<p>Who'd have thought biology could be so cool.  </p>
