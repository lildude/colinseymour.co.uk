<p>This is what you get when you let a crested black macaque get hold of your camera...</p>
<p><img class="center" alt="Monkey Self-portraits" src="/assets/monkey-selfportraits.jpg" width="620" height="388" /></p>
<p>First he discovers his own reflection and then he discovers the button and hey presto, he instantly takes far better self-portraits than 99% of humans can.</p>
<p>This is what a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/8615859/Monkey-steals-camera-to-snap-himself.html" target="_blank">wildlife photographer discovered</a> when he too a trip to a small national park north of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi to photograph these rare and endangered monkeys.</p>
<p>I love the picture on the right: it's the kind of self-portrait I've taken many a time and still tend to do everytime I get a new camera.</p>
