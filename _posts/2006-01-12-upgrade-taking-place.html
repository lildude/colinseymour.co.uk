<p>Just a polite notice to all - things are a bit quiet at work today, so I'm going to upgrade the underlying infrastructure of my site, <a href="https://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> to version 2.0. I've been running this on my <a href="https://playground.colinseymour.co.uk">test site</a> for several weeks without any problems, so thought I'd make the move here.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> All done now.  Only one small problem left to iron out - sub-pages of sub-pages with spaces in the name, don't seem to work at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> All fixed.  No idea why it didn't work, but re-creating one of the pages solved the problem.</p>
