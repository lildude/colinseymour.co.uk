<p>This time next week, Claire and I would have been happily married for a whole 2 &frac12; hours (assuming things finish at 14:30 on the dot).  I can say pretty much everything is in place now.  We've got a couple of things to finish off, like place cards and the music, but nothing major.  It should hopefully all fall into place on the day.</p>
<p>If you're coming to the wedding ceremony, be sure to be on time.  I'll be at the venue from 13:00 and the ceremony will start at 14:00 sharp.  I'm prepared to turn a blind eye if you surreptitiously slip me a couple <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/current/current_50.htm">reddies</a> when nobody is looking ;-) . </p>
<p>Whilst we don't have much to do, this next week is going to be hectic. It's all getting so exciting now.</p>
