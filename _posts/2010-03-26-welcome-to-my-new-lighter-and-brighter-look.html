<p>Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the new look <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk">colinseymour.co.uk</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of BluYel Theme on Day 1" src="/img/BluYel-Day1.jpg" width="600" height="302" /></p>
<p>As you can see, we're essentially the same as the last theme, just we're now sporting a lighter colour scheme with a lot more blue and white with a hint of yellow.  No more brown.</p>
<p>I've also moved the whole site across to a different server, so things may be slightly broken but hopefully I've already taken everything into account, but we'll see.</p>
<p>I hope you like the new look and hopefully better responsiveness too.</p>
