<p>Ask <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-18995657" target="_blank">a Londoner to select the correct flag</a> for their athletes at this year's Olympic games...</p>

<p>Yes folks, that is the SOUTH Korean flag next to the face of a NORTH Korean athlete (can we call footballer's "athletes"?).  As you can no doubt guess, the <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/965134/olympics-anger-over-north-korean-flag-blunder" target="_blank">North Korean players were not in the least bit impressed</a>.</p>
<p>Lets hope <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un" target="_blank">Kim Jong-un</a> accepts it as the simple mistake that it is and doesn't unleash his fury. Oh and that the organisers can get their act together and get the flags and national anthems right for the rest of the Olympics.</p>
