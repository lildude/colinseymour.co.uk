<p><img src="/img/casumarzu.jpg" alt="Casu Marzu" title="Casu Marzu" width="280" height="210" class="alignleft" />Last night's <a href="https://www.channel4.com/food/on-tv/f-word/">F-Word</a> featured probably the most disgusting cheese in the world: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casu_marzu">casu marzu</a>.<br />
This is a sheep's milk cheese from Sardinia, Italy that is effectively a Pecorino Sardo, but taken a stage further in the fermentation/maturation process.  </p>
<p>After a couple of weeks of maturation, the top of the cheese is cut open and the cheese is left open for the flies to get at it.  Yes, the flies; and this <em>is</em> intentional. Once the flies get in, they lay eggs which then grow and become larvae which eat, digest (and poop) the cheese. This turns the cheese from a hard cheese to a pungent soft cheese with live wiggly worms in it.</p>
<p>Apparently some people eat the cheese with the worms in, and others like to remove them first, but a sure sign that the cheese is good to eat is the worms are still alive.</p>
<p>I'm quite a fan of cheese, but I don't think I'm brave enough to try this one.</p>
