<p>The South African alcohol awareness peeps are getting a little over protective.  In fact, more protective than the UK peeps for a change.</p>
<p>Mum bought a new box of wine last night and found this printed, yes printed, on the side of the box:</p>
<p><!--more--><img src="/img/dont-drink-and-walk-on-the-road.jpg" alt="Don\'t Drink and Walk on the Road, You may be killed" title="Don\'t Drink and Walk on the Road, You may be killed" width="500" height="375" class="center" /></p>
<p>So, if you're going to drink, remember NO walking on the road.  By all means, hop, skip, jump, run or even DRIVE, but just don't walk - you might be killed.</p>
<p>You have been warned.</p>
<p>Thanks Mum.</p>
