<p>My mum and niece went away for the weekend and decided that they were going to have a braai on Sunday evening for dinner.  Nothing flash, just two burgers.  Now the catch: mum hasn't made a fire in years, if ever, and Sami has never made a fire, let alone one to cook food on.</p>
<p>Fear not, Sami set to it and built the sweetest fire I've every seen...</p>

<p>So neat and tidy and super economical too.  She used about 8 to 11 charcoal briquettes in total: a ring of 6 to 8 around a firelighter and what appears to be about 3 over the firelighter.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this was sufficient for them to braai the two hamburgers for their dinner.</p>
<p>Well done Sami.  I guess I won't need to do any braaiing when we come to visit at Christmas.  You can do it all :-)</p>
