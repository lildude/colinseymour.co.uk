<p>I have no idea where the idea came from or who started it, but last year it became quite a trend to wear a silicon wristband to show your support for a particular charity.  Yellow for Livestrong (Lance Armstrongs Cancer charity), White for Band Aid, Red for AID etc.  However, could <a href="http://www.thetechzone.com/?m=show&id=477">this</a> be the new band for 2006 - not only does it look like the part, but it's also useful - it's a USB memory stick wrapped round your wrist.  Now you can be trendy and carry all your personal files with you.</p>
