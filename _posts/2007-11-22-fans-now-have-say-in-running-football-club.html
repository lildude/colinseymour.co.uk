<p><img class="alignright" src="/img/ebbsfleet.gif" alt="Ebbsfleet United FC" />This is pretty amazing. <a href="http://www.ebbsfleetunited.co.uk/">Ebbsfleet United FC</a> will become the first football club to be taken over by a fan website.  <a href="http://www.myfootballclub.co.uk/">MyFootballClub</a> has agreed a deal in principle to purchase a controlling stake in Ebbsfleet United FC.</p>
<p>MyFootballClub members will have an equal say in team selection, player transfers and the general running of the club.  It's like Fantasy Football, but using a real club with real people.</p>
<p>Ebbsfleet United are currently 9th in the <a href="http://www.footballconference.co.uk/">Conference National table</a> and are just one step away from making it into league football for the first time in it's history.  </p>
<p><!--more-->It will be absolutely amazing if they manage to make their way all the way up to the Premiership, solely under the guidance of it's fans.  It'll also be interesting to see what happens if some super-rich Russian or American attempts to buy them out.  The MyFootballClub site says the members wouldn't make money off the deal and any profits would go back into the club, or to charity.  Money has an amazing ability to change people's minds.</p>
<p>Hey, maybe SA and England should introduce this method for selecting their national teams - both countries' coaches are getting paid a fortune and neither is delivering.  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7103110.stm">England is out of the 2008 Euros</a> and <a href="http://www.news24.com/News24/Sport/Soccer/0,9745,2-9-840_2222895,00.html">SA can't even beat the USA</a>.</p>
