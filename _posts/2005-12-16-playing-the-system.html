<p>How's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/4535132.stm">this</a> for playing the system.  Some homeless guy has been sentenced to life in jail following setting fire to wheelie bins - he actually wanted to go to jail.  This is one smart lazy man - he'll now get food, accomodation and a small wage all at the tax payers expense and all he had to do was set fire to some bins.</p>
