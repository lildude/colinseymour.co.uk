Well, this year is certainly the year for setting historical dates. Today sees the inauguration of South Africa's first female deputy president, and potentially paves the way for South Africa's first female president. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka was announced as the new deputy president yesterday by President Thabo Mbeki following his sacking of Jacob Zuma - Zuma was a very naughty boy and is being <a href="http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=243568">charged with corruption</a>.  Unfortunately, the new deputy president has a bit of her own <a href="http://www.mg.co.za/articledirect.aspx?articleid=243648">baggage</a> to sort out.</p>
