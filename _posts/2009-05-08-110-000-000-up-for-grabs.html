<p>Check it out, this week's <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/euromillions.php">EuroMillion's</a> jackpot is sitting at a whopping £110 000 000!!! Yes, <strong>£110 MILLION</strong>!!!</p>

<p>Think about it, if you were incredibly lazy and just bunged the £110 million into a bog-standard savings account offering a measly 2% interest (you wouldn't do this as you'd then become the owner of your bank and you'd make more money putting it elsewhere anyway), you'd receive £2.2 million a year (before tax) just in interest.  You'd never have to work another day in your life.</p>
<p>I've got my tickets, <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/euromillions.php">go get yours</a>.</p>
