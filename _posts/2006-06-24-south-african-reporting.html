<p>I was reading a story about how a man <a href="http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_1957080,00.html">heeded the call of nature</a> at a particularily dodgy junction on the N3 highway in Johannesburg and nearly got killed.  Quite a serious article, until I stumbled upon this paragraph...</p>
<blockquote><p>Walters says he stopped along the N3 at the London Road off-ramp near Alexandra to take a piddle at about 19:30.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don't you just love South African reporting.</p>
