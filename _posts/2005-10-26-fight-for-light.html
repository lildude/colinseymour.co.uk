<p>Kulula, one of SA's cheapo flight companies is campaigning for daylight savings time to be introduced in SA.  Head over to their <a href="https://www.kulula.com/kulula/I7/EN/static/indexfight.html">page</a> and read all about it.  Be sure to sign the petition (22374 votes already) - you may not live in SA, but just think what you could do with that extra hour when you go there on holiday.</p>
