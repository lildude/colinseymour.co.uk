<p><img src="/assets/roadworks.gif" alt="Roadworks" title="Roadworks" width="256" height="226" class="alignright" />Today must be "roadwork Wednesday".  I got stuck at 5 different sets of temporary lights, on 5 different roads, for 5 different "reasons" on my way to work this afternoon.   </p>
<p>There was the gas man, the telephone man, the leccy man, the water man (and his fountain) and the "I'm digging a hole for the sake of it" man - I'm really not sure who the last man was working for or what he was doing, but it looked like he was just digging a hole for the sake of it.</p>
<p>Maybe this is some new initiative by Wokingham Borough Council to get all road works done all at once, in one go.  One day's worth of inconvenience is better than 5 after all: unless you're like me and "lucky" enough to drive through all 5 on the same journey.</p>
