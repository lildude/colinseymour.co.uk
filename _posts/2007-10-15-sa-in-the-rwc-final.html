<p><img class="alignright" src="/img/habanafly.jpg" alt="Habana Flies" />Wooohooo!!! The Boks are into the rugby world cup final against England next weekend, and what a game it's going to be.  </p>
<p>In a way, I can't wait until the world cup is over - the anxiety generated by each of the recent games has been unbelievable, and last night was no exception.  Granted, it wasn't as nail biting as some of the previous knock-out games, but it was still a great game.  Argentina, as they have in the entire world cup, played out of their socks.  They have proven to the world that they're a force to be reckoned with, and deserve their #4 slot in the <a href="http://www.irb.com/rankings/index.html">world rankings</a>. As for South Africa, they've lived up to the expectations placed on them.</p>
<p>Saturday's game is going to be very interesting and exciting. Both teams will have something to prove: England are going to want to prove the earlier white-wash was just a once-off, and South Africa want to prove it was not. Both teams are in fine form and hungry for the trophy.</p>
<p>I do have one regret - I wish I'd put money on Bryan Habana being the <a href="http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/statistics/index.html">top try scorer</a> for the world cup.  That guy is amazing, and I just love how he always launches himself across the try line, even if he's not under any pressure. Watch this man closely on Saturday - England certainly will be.</p>
