<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> recently purchased a web site traffic analysis company, Urchin, and have now taken on their old "analytics" features, got rid of the $199 price tag and are now offering this service for free under the name "<a href="//www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>".  To quote the website "<em>Google Analytics tells you everything you want to know about how your visitors found you and how they interact with your site</em>".  I've just activated this on my site, so should hopefully have some cool stats to play with soon.</p>
