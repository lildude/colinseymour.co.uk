<p>Thanks to new <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/21/acre_abolished/">European law</a>, Winnie the Pooh is going to need a re-write.  He's not allowed to live in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Acre_Wood">Hundred Acre Wood</a> anymore.  Instead he has to live in the 40.4685642 Hectare Wood.</p>
