<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wheres-Stig-Top-Gear/dp/1846078083/&tag=costest-21"><img class="alignleft" src="https://colinseymour.smugmug.com/photos/629999284_GmmBu-114x160.jpg" alt="Where's Stig" /></a>Were you one of those kids who used to spend hours upon hours pouring over a book searching for a man wearing a red and white striped shirt and a blue ball-ended beanie called Wally (or Waldo in other parts of the world)?  I certainly was and was quite excited to <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/wheres-wally-in-the-uk">find him in Putney highstreet</a> in March. Well, guess what, now you can do it again with a new an improved version from the BBC and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/">Top Gear</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of hunting for Wally/Waldo, you have to search for <a href="http://www.topgear.com/uk/stig">The Stig</a> in the new <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wheres-Stig-Top-Gear/dp/1846078083/&tag=costest-21">Where's Stig</a> book. If the cover is anything to go by - a rendition of their US trip - I suspect you may be recognising different scenes, people and cars from their episodes and ventures.  I've managed to piece together the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect-home/costest-21">Amazon.co.uk</a> preview images so you can see for yourself (click images below for larger images):</p>

<p>This book is apparently aimed at kids, but come on, we all know more adults are going to buy this book for themselves than for their kids.  I think I might too as Jr is too small to read at the moment ;-) .</p>
<p>The book is due to go on sale on 17 September, however both <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wheres-Stig-Top-Gear/dp/1846078083/&tag=costest-21">Amazon.co.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wheres-Stig-Top-Gear/dp/1846078083/&tag=costest-20">Amazon.com</a> are taking pre-orders in anticipation of it's arrival.</p>
