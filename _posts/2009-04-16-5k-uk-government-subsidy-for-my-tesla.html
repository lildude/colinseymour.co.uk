<p>The UK government has <a href="https://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/engineering/article6103536.ece">announced that they'll give me up to £5000</a> towards my first electric or hybrid vehicle sometime in 2011.  Very nice.  Thank-you very much.  </p>

<p>Of course, if I'm going to go green, I want to be sure it's 100% leccy and the only leccy car to go for is the <a href="https://www.teslamotors.com/">Tesla Roadster</a> (the red one) with its sub-4 second 0-60mph, limited top speed of 125mph and range of about 220 miles. Sadly, with the government's £5000 donation, I'll still be a long way off from the £87 000 needed to buy a Tesla Roadster when they <a href="https://www.reghardware.co.uk/2009/04/14/tesla_london_showroom/">arrive in the UK</a>.</p>
<p>That said, if I start saving now, maybe I'll have enough for the larger <a href="https://www.teslamotors.com/models/index.php">Tesla Model S</a> (the white one) when it launches in 2011 in the US and 2012 in the UK.  The US price is expected to be $49 900, so the UK price won't be far off.</p>
<p>For the time being, I'll stick to my petrol <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/my-new-car-the-vw-golf-gt">Golf GT</a> and start collecting really long extension cords - there aren't many charging points near work or home, so it'll be needed.</p>
