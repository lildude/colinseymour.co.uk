<p>For those who missed it, here are some pics I took of the lunar eclipse that occurred last night:</p>

<p>This is my first step into night photography with my Nikon D50 and I'm quite impressed with the results.  Naturally, I could do with a bit more practise.</p>
<p>I did have to do a bit of improvising - I don't have a proper camera tripod yet, so I located a spare bolt (from our old bed) and bolted my camera to the tripod of the telescope I've got (got it for long service at Sun).  This did pretty much what a normal tripod does except without a conventional head.</p>
<p>I'm pretty impressed with the shots - only the total eclipse seems to have suffered any noticeable blur, and this was caused by the shutter - I don't have a remote, so I couldn't do the mirror lock-up trick used to prevent this. </p>
