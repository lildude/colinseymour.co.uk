<p>I'm in San Francisco on a work conference thingy this week so will only be able to post/comment when I can get a slot on one of the workstations.  </p>
<p>So far I've learnt...</p>
<ol>
<li>Drinking lots of water really does seem to help with jetlag</li>
<li>... but I seem to only be able to last about 1h30 - 2hrs before I need another pee</li>
<li>Some of the directors at work are really really really boring and I really should have stayed in bed this morning</li>
<li>When getting a free breakfast, don't expect fruit - only soggy fried crap.</li>
</ol>
<p>This afternoon should be a bit more entertaining as I'll get to go to a couple of techie talks by some hardcore techies I know, so I shouldn't be too bored.  Then it's off for a power nap and then some mozying around town.</p>
