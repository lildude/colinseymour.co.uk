<p>It's all over the everywhere, but I just felt it was worth mentioning here, too. Sadly, Michael Jackson died yesterday, 25 June 2009 at the age of 50.  He was a supremely talented musician who has no doubt had a huge impact on a lot of other musicians over the years.  I'm sure we'll all be hearing the tributes over the next few days but he'll live on in people's memories for a lot longer.</p>
<p>Watch the music charts this and next week; I think we may have a Michael Jackson number 1. Possibly Man in the Mirror or Thriller - the two tracks that are already in iTunes' top 100. If <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect-home/costest-21">Amazon's</a> sales charts are anything to go by, it could be a definite: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/music/">Amazon's top 15 selling albums</a> are currently <strong>ALL</strong> Michael Jackson related.</p>
<p>Whilst searching for a picture for this post, I stumbled upon this very moving video.  Apparently it's from a Pepsi advert...</p>
