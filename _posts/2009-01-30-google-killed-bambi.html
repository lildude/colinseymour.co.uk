<p>It's a terrible thing to kill a wild animal.  It's worse to get caught. It's even worse still to be caught by your own camera.  This is exactly what has happened with the Google Streetview car.</p>
<p>The chappies were doing their thing down <a href="https://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&layer=c&cbll=42.953661,-77.663251&panoid=Tt3UIYMdqLicVdLzt5AsHQ&cbp=12,174.27411587921335,,0,15.224757601150582&t=h&ll=42.953533,-77.663212&spn=0,359.85323&z=13">Five Points Rd, Rush, New York</a> (yes, New York has crunchy side - it is a state and city) when they obviously spotted the deer entering the road and decided to floor it and see what would happen next. Except they forgot one teensy weensy thing - the fancy recording thingy stuck on the roof of their car.</p>
<p>Google have now removed the images from their Streetview for this section of the road, but thanks to some quick thinking peeps, I can bring you the images for your perusal.</p>
