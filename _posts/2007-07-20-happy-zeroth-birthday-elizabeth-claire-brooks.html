<p>May she bring you years of joy and happiness.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was born at about 22:15pm last night, 19 July 2007, and weighed in at 6 pounds 12 ounces (approx 3kg).</p>
<p>Mummy and baby are both doing well and Claire is ecstatic to be an Auntie now.</p>
<p>I wonder if it's just a co-incidence that her initials have a significant meaning in the UK - <a href="http://www.ecb.co.uk/">ECB</a></p>
