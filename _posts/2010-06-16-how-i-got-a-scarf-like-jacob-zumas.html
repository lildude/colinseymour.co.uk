<p>I happened comment to my mum about how I liked the scarf Jacob Zuma was wearing at the opening ceremony of the football World Cup...</p>

<p>Mum, then took it upon herself to see if she could source one for herself and me.  After a lot of trawling on the internet, she gave up and decided to email the President instead...</p>

<p>TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN</p>
<p>Please advise where I may purchase a scarf like the one worn by<br />
President Zuma at the World Cup opening game.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I am currently house-bound following a serious motor<br />
vehicle accident, but would love to purchase one for myself and one for<br />
my son, who is currently living in England.</p>
<p>Trusting that you will be able to assist with my query.</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Obviously, this was a shot in the dark, but there's no harm asking.</p>
<p>Well blow me down with a feather.  My mum actually got a reply, and a useful one at that...</p>
<blockquote><p>Coming</p></blockquote>
<p>Now how's that for a responsive presidential office of a third world president?  I'm impressed.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, it turns out they're being sold on the side of the road all over South Africa, but of course mum wouldn't know this being confined to the house. :-)</p>
