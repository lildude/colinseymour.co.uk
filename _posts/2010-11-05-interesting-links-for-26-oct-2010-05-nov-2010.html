A real advancement in electric car technology.  Looks like more hurdle is about to fall.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11664660">BBC News - Exercise 'can prevent a cold', a study shows</a> - "But you may not have to actually do much exercise - those who merely think they are fit enjoy the same lower risk."<br />
