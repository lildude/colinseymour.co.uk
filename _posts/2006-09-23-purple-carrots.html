<p>Look what I saw and bought in Sainsburys today...</p>

<p>Yes, purple carrots.  We've all heard that carrots used to be purple before the Dutch decided to be a little too patriotic but I'd never seen them.  So when I saw these today, I couldn't resist.  I'll let you know how they taste when we come to eat them.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and Christmas has ALREADY started in our Sainsburys - the shelves were being filled with Christmas tat this morning.</p>
