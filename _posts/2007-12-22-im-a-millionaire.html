<p>Woohooo!!! I'm a millionaire, and I can't even buy a single roll of loo paper... if I were living in Zimbabwe.  I happened to stumble upon an article on BBC News about <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7153112.stm">Zimbabwe's new high denomination notes</a> coming into circulation on Thursday, and thought... how many British Pounds would I need to be a millionaire in Zimbabwe?  Well, I'm pleased to say, I am finally a millionaire:</p>

<p>Check out that exchange rate. All I need is Â£16.83 to get a million Zim Dollars. Pity I can't actually buy anything with it. I guess using the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7131500.stm">notes for business cards</a> isn't such a bad idea after all.</p>
