<p>Ok, consommÃ© is probably not the right word for it, but it's what all the top chefs call it.  Maybe "tasty clear liquid" is a better description as the method detailed isn't really that used to make a consommÃ© in the real sense of the word, and isn't exclusive to meats anymore.</p>
<p>Traditionally, consommÃ©s are meat based, timely, and expensive to make, and generally only the poshest of restaurants make and serve them.  That is until now.</p>
<p><!--more-->Top chefs are now making strawberry, carrot and even chocolate consommÃ©s using a rather ingenious method.  Instead of using egg white and painstakingly boiling and skimming until they get the desired liquid, they're using a method that involves adding gelatin to the liquid, freezing, thawing and forgetting for 2 to 3 days, to extract the flavorful juices.</p>
<p>To quote the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/05/dining/05curi.html">article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The process, though it takes two or three days, is simple. First you make juice or flavorful broth and strain it to remove any particles. Then you dissolve gelatin in the liquid, but only a little bit â€” just a fraction of what youâ€™d use in a set gelatin dessert. (You donâ€™t need to add gelatin to meat stocks, which already contain it.)</p>
<p>Then you freeze the liquid overnight, place the frozen block in a strainer over a bowl and let it thaw in the refrigerator a day or two. Liquid slowly drips into the bowl. This is the consommÃ©.</p></blockquote>
<p>When I read this my taste buds quickly jumped to attention.  Imagine all the different flavours you could combine without actually affecting the appearance of the food. :-p</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/05/dining/05curi.html">whole article</a> for more details on this ingenious "gravy" making.</p>
