<p>What do you get when you take one on-form European team: Portugal, one team of minnows: North Korea, add a generous splash of rain to give it that European feel,  and then mix it all up in Cape Town?  World Cup 2010's first true goal-fest.</p>
<p>Portugal pulled out the stops yesterday to hand North Korea the thumping of a life time. Sadly for the propaganda machine that works it's "magic" in North Korea, this was also the first game the North Korean government <a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/jun/21/north-korea-tv-portugal-world-cup" target="_blank">allowed to be broadcast live in North Korea</a> - ooops.</p>

<p>Impressive stuff there with Christiano Ronaldo on fine form with a bar-shaking shot and then some very impressive (or was that lucky?) ball skills for his goal.  Somehow I don't think Portugal will be <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8739146.stm" target="_blank">complaining about the ball</a>.</p>
<p>Hold thumbs that we're in for a goal-fest this afternoon.  Bafana Bafana need to hand France a thumping like this.  I doubt it'll happen, but you never know; <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8750302.stm" target="_blank">given the troubles in the French camp</a>, maybe the French will <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8752637.stm" target="_blank">decide to go on strike</a> for the game after all.</figure>
