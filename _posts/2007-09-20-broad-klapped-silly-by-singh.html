<p><strong>Q</strong>: What do Stuart Broad (England) and Daan van Bunge (Netherlands) have in common?<br />
<strong>A</strong>: They've both been smashed for 6 consecutive sixes in one over this year.</p>
<p>As we all know, <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/blog/world-record-cricket-pure-carnage/">Daan van Bunge was clobbered all over the park by Herschelle Gibbs</a> during this year's cricket world cup, and unfortunately, last night Stuart Broad suffered the same fate and became the first 6x6 casualty in Twenty-20 cricket history. This time by Yuvraj Singh of India, on his way to the fastest international 50 ever - off only 12 balls. (<a href="http://worldtwenty20.yahoo.com/videos/enin1909.html">video here</a>)  </p>
<p><!--more-->6 sixes an over isn't really that surprising considering the nature of the Twenty-20 game: we all knew it wouldn't be long before we saw this happen, but off one of England's main bowers - now that wasn't expected. I would have expected it off a lesser cricketing nation, not England.</p>
<p>As you can guess, England lost to India, but they really shouldn't have - they only lost by 18 runs.  England really should have started their innings (they batted 2nd) a bit more aggressively. Unfortunately, it means they're also out of the Twenty-20 World Cup for this year too. </p>
<p>Don't worry all you England supporters, you can now start supporting South Africa - they're still doing well :-) </p>
