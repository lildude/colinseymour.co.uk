<p>Well, my web hosting company is a bit useless, so I'm moving my websites to my own machine. I then have full control over what functionality I require. The downside is I have to admin them myself, but I suppose that's better than not having the functionality I need.</p>
<p>I also need to make the changes soon as spam bots have discovered my site and are now filling the comments with useless advertising for online gambling and poker. The new site has protection against this.</p>
<p>Until <a href="http://www.lildude.co.uk">http://www.lildude.co.uk</a> has moved, you can view the new site at <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk">http://colinseymour.co.uk</a> or <a href="http://www.colinseymour.com">http://www.colinseymour.com</a> (it's the same site). I will no longer be updating this blog and will announce when <a href="http://www.lildude.co.uk">http://www.lildude.co.uk</a> has moved.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I've merged all the entries from the old site to this site now.</p>
