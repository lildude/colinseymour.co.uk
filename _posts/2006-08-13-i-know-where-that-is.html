Everyone is well aware of the terrorism plot foiled by the police the other day, but I've just found out that one of the <a href="https://www.getreading.co.uk/news/2003/2003065/antiterror_raid_on_internet_cafe">internet cafes raided</a>, after the event as part of evidence gathering, is just down the road from us.  Claire and I actually walked right past this place on Thursday evening. Looks like someone has been a naughty boy on their computers.</p>
