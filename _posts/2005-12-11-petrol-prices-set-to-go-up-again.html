<p>I felt a rumbling in the flat at about 6:05 this morning as I ate my toast and drank my tea, and it was'nt my bowels.  I got to work and almost everyone else noticed it too.  BBC News soon <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4517962.stm">revealed</a> the cause of the rumbling - 3 explosions at an oil depot in Hemel Hempstead. Best fill up now before the price of petrol goes up again.</p>
