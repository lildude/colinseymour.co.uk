<p>It's now 16:42 UK time and we're home and will be staying put for the rest of the evening and probably most of tomorrow. We've done the week's grocery shopping and the washing is on, now just to try keep out eyes open to tempt our bodies into thinking it's not 08:42 California time.  Being up since about 8am California time YESTERDAY will probably help.</p>
<p>As you can imagine we're absolutely knackered (typing this post is proving to be challenge) and looking forward to a good night's sleep back in our own bed.  I'm not going to waffle on too much now, but suffice to say we had a terrific time, took <acronym title="lots and lot">maningy</acronym> photos, and I have a stack of posts up my sleeve. </p>
