<div style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; text-align: center">Happy Birthday Claire</div>
<p>Well, we're in for a manic drive today: right across Golden Gate Bridge and round several bays to Napa. The 52 miles are going to be a killer :-) hee hee hee.</p>
<p>We thought we'd take it easy on our first drive in the US.  In case you missed it above, it's also Claire's birthday today, and no one wants to spend their birthday stuck inside a car.  So we're heading over early and will be having a relaxing day to celebrate Claire's birthday.  I'm sure some wine and good food will be involved too; it is the wine area after all ;-)</p>
<p>Today's route it likely to be very similar to this...</p>
