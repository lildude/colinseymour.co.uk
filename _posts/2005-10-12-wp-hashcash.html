<p>Word of warning... if you're using the <a href="https://elliottback.com/wp/archives/2005/05/11/wordpress-hashcash-20/">WP-Hashcash</a> plugin - don't disable it and leave it disabled for too long.  Comment spam suddenly goes through the roof. I disabled it with the intention of tidying up my plugins... bad idea. It's back on an updated to v2.3 too.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I've disabled this again as it's made no difference.</p>
