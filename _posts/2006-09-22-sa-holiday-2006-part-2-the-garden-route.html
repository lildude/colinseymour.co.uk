<p>Our original plans were to arrive in Jo'burg on the 20th, and immediately fly down to George, pick up a hire car and head to Hermanus for the night and next day.  I've never been to Hermanus and thought it would be cool for Claire and I to go see the whales - it was whale season after all.  </p>
<p>Well, thanks to Air France's incompetence, I've still never been to Hermanus - we had to cancel our night/day in Hermanus and instead we got to kill 24 hours in Paris.  It just doesn't compare.  We managed this by visiting the Sacre-Coeur and then having lunch in the Latin Quarter. I took a couple of pics, but not enough for their own collection, so I've bunged them in my Random Album.</p>
<p>We eventually arrived in SA and carried on with the rest of our holiday along the Garden Route. SAA were kind enough to rebook (for R160pp) our flights to George for the very next day.  <em>Thanks SAA</em>.</p>
<p>Tempest/Sixt car hire were also kind enough to adjust our pickup day too. <em>Thanks Tempest/Sixt</em>.</p>
<p>Accomodation for the rest of the time there was provided courtesy of mum's timeshare swap at a great place called Castleton Holiday Apartments, on the edge of Plettenberg Bay. <em>Thanks mum</em>.</p>
<p>The week was spent visiting Knysna, Oudtshoorn, the Cango Caves, Plett and the Tsitsikamma National Park. The weather was crap everyday except the last, but it was still very enjoyable stay and definitely makes it onto my "must go back there again" list.</p>
<p>All my pictures from this week are now in my <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/gallery/">gallery</a>. Enjoy.</p>
