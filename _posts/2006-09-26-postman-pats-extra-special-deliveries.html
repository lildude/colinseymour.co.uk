<p>Did you know Postman Pat has a son named Julian?  Nope?  Neither did I until Claire mentioned it last night after talking to her uncle Stephen.</p>
<p>Now this brings up a couple of questions...</p>
<ol>
<li>Postman Pat was never married when I watched it and only lived with Jess, his cat. So is he married now?</li>
<li>If so, to whom and when did this happen?</li>
<li>If not, does that mean Pat has been delivering some extra special packages on his rounds? ;-)</li>
<li>Who's Julian's mum, or is Pat like Arnold Schwarzenegger in Junior?</li>
</ol>
<p>On an related topic - what does Postman Pat feed Jess?  Jess has got to be the oldest cat in history.</p>
