<p>I seem to have a bug in my sidenotes code - the comment count doesn't seem to increment when people comment.  Will have to fix this as I nearly missed out on a comment in my previous sidenote.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update: </strong>Now it seems to either display 0 or 2 randomly for the number of comments... hmmm</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Update: </strong>Fixed it.  Comment count is working correctly again.</em></p>
