<p>We've known it for years, economy class is just a fancy name for cattle class, and easyJet have actually finally admitted it.  Well, not directly, but they do allude to it in their FAQ section when answering "<a href="http://easyjet.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/easyjet.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=423&p_created=1125582870&p_sid=diJYIvxi&p_accessibility=0&p_redirect=&p_lva=64&p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9MjEmcF9wcm9kcz0mcF9jYXRzPSZwX3B2PSZwX2N2PSZwX3BhZ2U9MSZwX3NlYXJjaF90ZXh0PWFzc2lzdGFuY2U*&p_li=&p_topview=1">Do you offer assistance to elderly passengers?</a>":</p>

<p>Note the question, then note the category on the left. </p>
<p>Hmmmm, so airlines <em>do</em> think of us as nothing more than cattle after all.</p>
