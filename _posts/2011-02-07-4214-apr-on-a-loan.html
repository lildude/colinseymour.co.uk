<p>I've highlighted exorbitant interest rates on loans before.  Back in 2007, I thought <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/crazy-loan-interest-rates">177% APR</a> was an insanely steep interested rate, but two years later I stumbled upon some astonishing interest rates that I thought would <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/the-loans-that-will-bankrupt-you">bankrupt you</a>.  Oh I was so wrong. Those loans won't bankrupt you, the ones currently being advertised on TV from Wonga.com definitely will...</p>

<p>Now I will admit that the standardised use of APR as a comparative measurement of the cost of a loan is a bit misleading when it comes to short term loans, which Wonga.com deal in, but still.  It makes you think.  If you use the services of wonga.com for a lot of short term loans over a year or roll your loans over and over and over again, which the people who are likely to need this service are likely to do, there's a very good chance you'll end up paying pretty close to the 4214% APR.</p>
<p>Could this be classed as exploitation of the poor? Labour MP Stella Creasy thinks so. She has <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9385000/9385935.stm" target="_blank">proposed a motion</a> for these type of loans, collectively called "payday loans" to be debated in the House of Commons to get some sort of regulation in place.</p>
<p>If you find yourself in a position of needing one of these loans, and there really is no alternative: don't fall for the gimmicky name and TV advert. Shop around.  I found a comparison site which clearly shows Wonga.com is the most expensive by almost twice as much as its next closest competitor in terms of APR.</p>
