<p><a href="http://www.flicr.com">Flickr</a>, the site I use to store my photos for this site, has just dropped the price for their paid subscription.  I've gone for it now cos I was starting to hit the restrictions of the free service on a regular basis, but couldn't substantiate the $47 odd they used to charge ($24ish now).  So from now on I will be storing a lot more pictures on Flickr and as a consequence, there will be a lot more pics in my gallery.</p>
