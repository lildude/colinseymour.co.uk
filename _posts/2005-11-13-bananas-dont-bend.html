<p>I was flipping through a home shopping catalogue that came in one of Claire's magazines and I stumbled on this little delight.  It's a Banana Guard - essentially, just an individual lunchbox for your banana to protect it from getting mashed in your bag.  What a good idea, however there's one thing that struck me as rather odd... the shape.  The catalogue (and <a href="http://www.lakelandlimited.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/GBP/ParametricSearch-Start;sid=npX8i0Mb1p0UkABsCrv3jevbJEkdxdJS8ZY=?search_typecode=2&search_typecode=4&search_typecode=10&search_typecode=16&search_online=true&search_category_recursive=true&search_attribute_refno=SKU&sort_attribute_1=product_name&sort_direction_1=ascending&search_precision_refno=0&search_query_refno=10380">website</a>) state it's <em>"designed to accommodate virtually every shape and size of banana"</em>.  My first thought was - except the bendy ones.</p>
<p>What ever happened to bendy "moon shaped" bananas?  Bananas now seem to bend in the first 5 centimetres and then go straight for the rest.  This can't have been the case all the time... ask anyone to draw a banana and it'll resemble a crescent rather than the semi-straight things we get today.</p>
<p>I'm tempted to get one of these just to see if I can find a banana that doesn't fit.  Granted, I may have to travel half way round the world to some country that doesn't have rules on how fruit and veg should bend and look - before you ask, yes the EU has rules on what fruit and veg should look like (the BBC list a few in <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2066730.stm">this</a> strange article on bananas), however I feel Spain doesn't follow these rules - they have some of the most real and rustic looking fruit and veg I've ever seen.</p>
