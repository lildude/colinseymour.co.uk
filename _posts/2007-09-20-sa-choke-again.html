<p>Once again, South Africa have choked when it matters most.  South Africa are out of the Twenty-20 cricket world cup.  What makes this more disappointing is that South Africa didn't even have to win.  They needed 154 to win, but only 126 to go through on run rate, and they couldn't manage it. Oh well, we've still got the rugby to win.</p>
