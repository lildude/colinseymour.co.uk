<p>No, not the muscian/rapper, South Africa's <strong>Former</strong> deputy president, Jacob Zuma, who immediately following fraud charges, is now facing rape charges.</p>
<p>You see Jay Z was a very naughty boy and apparently raped an HIV positive family friend - hmmm, some friend.</p>
<p>Anyway, the HIV status came up in the ongoing court case along with the fact that Mr Zuma knew but still didn't use a condom. Instead he had a shower.  <strong>A SHOWER???!!!!</strong></p>
<p>He's quoted to have said â€œ<em>I knew the risk was very minimal</em>â€ (who says "very minimal"???) and he went on to say he knew there was a risk of getting HIV/AIDS, but he believed it was small, from knowledge he had gained whilst serving on the Aids Council.</p>
<p>This same council must have told him taking a shower after the act â€œ<em>â€¦ would minimise the risk of contracting the disease ...</em>â€.</p>
<p>Oh and of course the health minister, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang refuses to comment on Jay Zâ€™s wreckless actions for fear of influencing the court case with her opinion.  Come on your stupid woman, condemning his comments is not giving an opinion on his guilt status.</p>
<p>The country is rife with HIV/AIDS and it really doesn't need former politicians telling them crap like this.</p>
<p>I must say, I'm loving the headlines <a href="http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Zuma/0,,2-7-1840_1910667,00.html" title="Zuma Rape Trial">News24</a> are coming up with...</p>
