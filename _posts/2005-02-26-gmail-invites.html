<p><img class="alignright" src="/img/gmaillogo.jpg" alt="Gmail logo" />Did you know people are selling Gmail invites on Ebay?  Yup, invites to a FREE email service are being sold on Ebay.  At the moment each invite seems to be going for about £1, but before Google started handing out the invites like there's no tomorrow, some were fetching as much as £100.  Yup, you read right, £100!!! for something that is essentially free.</p>
<p>Well, I'm not that much of a money scrounging fool, I've got 50 invites to give away if anyone wants one.  So spread the news, PingBack to this post (<a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/gmail-invites">PingBack URI</a>) from your blog and I'll come hunting for your email address on your blog and send you an invite. Simple really.</p>
<p>Now this is the true test to see how well Google and MSN index my blog :-)</p>
<p>Oh, and please remember, I'm only offering these to people who pingback to this post, so don't leave a comment asking for an invite.</p>
