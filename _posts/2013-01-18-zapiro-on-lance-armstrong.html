<p>Great cartoon from Zapiro in yesterday's Mail & Guardian...</p>

<p>Think I need to burn my copy of the first book, but can't wait for the second... assuming he tries to make a bit of cash off his "struggle with 'roids".</p>
<p>And to think I once thought this guy was a great example to kids. Kids, Lance Armstrong is still a great example... of what NOT to do.  Be more like <a href="https://barefootrunner.co.uk/is-winning-all-that-counts-are-you-absolutely-sure-about-that" target="_blank">Iván Fernández Anaya</a> instead.</p>
