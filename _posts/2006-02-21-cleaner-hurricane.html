<p>It's like a hurricane has smashed it's way through my desk every time the cleaners clean my desk at work - telephone here, keyboard there, mouse.... hey where is my mouse? Despite this aggressive method of cleaning, they still don't seem to be able to get all the bread cumbs from between my keyboard's keys.</p>
