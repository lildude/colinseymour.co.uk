<p>Just finished watching the game.  South Africa started well, but they've got a bit of work to do if they plan on winning the World Cup. Only 3 points in the 2nd half!? Very scrappy 2nd half. Best thing about the game?  Claire spotted a banner - "<em>Hi Ma! Send Biltong!</em>". You gotta love Saffers abroad.</p>
