<p>Bit of a gamer, or maybe even a SciFi reader? Or maybe you just fancy learning a bit of Unix so you can test out Linux/Solaris/BSD/OSX and know what you're doing?  Then check out <a href="http://unixmages.com/">Unix for the Beginning Mage</a>  It's a short book that teaches the very basics to learning the Unix (and Unix-like Operating Systems) command line by using spells and mages as metaphors. Everything from typing your first command to learning about symbolic links is covered. The book is availabe in treeware and free PDF formats.</p>
