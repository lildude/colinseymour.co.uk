Prison officers at Wakefield Prison has been <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/4305798.stm">told</a> they can no longer wear a tie-pin that bears the English national flag, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Georges_Cross">St Georges Cross</a>. Not for fear of safety, choking, or even because it's not part of the uniform, but because it may be "misinterpreted" as a racist symbol.</p>
<p>Come on... surely this is taking PC just a bit too far.  This is England, not post-apartheid South Africa or post-Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>If it's going to be so easily "misinterpreted", then surely we should be looking for a new flag, a new patron saint and a new football kit as they all bear the St Georges cross - come to think of it, many pubs will have to change too.</p>
