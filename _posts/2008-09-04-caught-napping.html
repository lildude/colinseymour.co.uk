<p>I've just realised today that my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/UnofficialZapiro">Zapiro feed</a> hasn't been updated in a while.  Well, a little investigation soon revealed the cause: I've been caught napping.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mg.co.za">M&G</a> have updated their website and in the process moved the location of the Zapiro cartoons. I rely on screen-scraping to grab the cartoons so things soon broke. I've been so busy lately, I've been neglecting my logs too so missed the fact my script was failing.</p>
<p>Well, not anymore.  I've updated my script to account for the new M&G site layout and the feed should be producing updates from now on.</p>
