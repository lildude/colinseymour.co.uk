How's this for a major cock up... the whole world has heard about how the Metropolitan Police blew an innocent Brazilian's brains out just after the London bombings as they believed he was another terrorist.  Well, a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4158832.stm">leaked report</a> has come to light that reveals that the Met Police got it sooo wrong, all because the officer who was meant to video him to confirm his identity had gone for a slash.  Someone then took it upon themselves to "positively" identify him as a terrorist and things just tumbled from there. </p>
<p>So if you're scared of travelling on the tube for fear of being blown to pieces by terrorist - don't be.  It's the police you've got to be scared of, they blow peoples brains out for sport* these days.</p>
<p>* - It can only be for sport, how else do you account for the seven shots in the head and one in the shoulder</p>
