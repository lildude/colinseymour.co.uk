<p>So you're a marketing genius tasked with coming up with IKEA's next advert.  You turn to your drawing board and start sketching out some ideas, but nothing comes to mind.  Feeling uninspired, you stop for a moment, stroke your trusty feline leg warmer and BAMM!!! The idea comes to you. Why not set 100 cats loose in the Wembley branch of IKEA for shits and giggles, film it and see what you can make of it.</p>
<p>And that's exactly what they did...</p>

<p>Brilliant idea, though when I look at the neck-high perspex partition things being used and moved around (and the fool behind one of them), I can't help but think the person who thought they were a good idea doesn't own a cat.  6 feet is nothing for a cat.</p>
<p>If you're in the UK, you've probably already seen the final result on TV. If you're not, here's the finished product..</p>
