<p>Nando's in South Africa has a reputation for coming up with some of the best adverts you'll ever see on TV.  Many are spoofs, insults or just quick jabs at current affairs, so it's not surprising that they're at it again. What is surprising is when someone comes back and one-ups a Nando's advert.</p>
<p>First, Santam (insurance company) released this advert...</p>

<p>A very good advert and, yes, I did replay it to make sure.  Off the back of this, Nandos came out with...</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Y03wspg2DcA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Not bad.  Still makes your smile, but who'd have guessed Santam would be so quick off the block and release this...</p>

<p>Now I'll be very impressed if Nando's fulfils this "demand" and actually creates an advert from it. Time will tell.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> 25 Apr 2012 - According to <a href="http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/no-chickening-out-in-battle-of-the-ads-1.1283474" target="_blank">IOL</a>, Nando's will be delivering today, ahead of schedule.  Other sources suggest Nando's are going one better and not just delivering once, but repeatedly over the next 12 months. Still need to find a reliable source for this last bit, but nice one Nando's. You'll keep getting my money.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> 26 Apr 2012 - And here we have it, the <a href="http://www.businesslive.co.za/southafrica/sa_companies/2012/04/25/nando-s-proves-it-s-not-chicken-in-santam-spoof" target="_blank">final word</a>.  Nando's will be delivering a free meal to the Jo'burg kid's home every month for the next 12 months.  That's brilliant Nando's.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> 27 Apr 2012 - And as expected, Nando's have done an advert about it too...</p>
