<p>Bacn - this is a new tech buzz word I'm sure will slowly be making it's way into everyday conversation, just like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_%28electronic%29">spam</a> did many many years ago.</p>
<p>Bacn, pronounced "bacon", is all the low priority email alerts you receive that arenâ€™t spam, but arenâ€™t exactly personal either. It's the type of email you've actually requested, but still makes you feel it's cluttering up your Inbox.</p>
<p>Stuff like Facebook notifications, Google alerts, e-bills, E-Bay bid notices etc.  All the stuff you want, but just not right now.</p>
<p>If you're wondering "Why bacn?", well quite simple really, it's better than spam. (The loss of the "o" is a Web 2.0 thing).</p>
