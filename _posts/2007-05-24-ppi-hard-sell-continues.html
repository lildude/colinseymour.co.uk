<p>I just got this morning's post and it seems Alliance & Leicester didn't quite understand me when <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/al-ppi-hard-sell">I rejected their PPI cover</a>.  They've sent a letter today with a form already filled in waiting for me to sign it and send it back. I sent it... straight to the bin.</p>
