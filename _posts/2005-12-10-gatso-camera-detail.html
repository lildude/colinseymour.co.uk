<p>Ever wondered how much detail <a href="http://www.speedcamerasuk.com/Gatso.htm">Gatso</a> speed cameras really capture?  How's this for an answer? </p>
<p><img class="centered" src="/assets/smileforcamera.jpg" alt="Joyriders Smile for the Camera" /></p>
<p>This was taken of a bunch of joyriders who were kind enough to smile for the camera and was published in several newspapers (<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/12/09/njoy09.xml">The Telegraph</a>, <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1917805,00.html#">The Times</a>).  </p>
<p>Notice how you can even see the speed on the speedometer. (It's clearer in the images in the newspapers).</p>
