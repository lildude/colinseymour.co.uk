<p><img class="alignleft" src="/img/prince-planetearthcdcover.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Prince - Planet Earth CD Cover" />As a fan of Prince, I was quite pleased to hear about Prince doing things his way again, by offering his newest CD, Planet Earth, free with today's The Mail on Sunday newspaper.  </p>
<p>News of his intentions has been in the press for a couple of weeks now and today's the big day. Naturally, a lot of people are quite pleased by this news, however a lot of people in the music industry, particularly those that make money off his hard work, aren't too impressed.  This gambit is an insignificant expense to Prince, however it will have a far reaching effect and may lead to other artists doing the same in the future.</p>
<p>Prince has made a lot of money as a musician so far in his career and this is one of his ways of effectively giving back something to his fans. I've got my copy.</p>
