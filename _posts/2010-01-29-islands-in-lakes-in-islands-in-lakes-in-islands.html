<p>Everyone knows that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_islands_by_area">Greenland</a> is the world's largest island and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea">Caspsian Sea</a> is actually the world's largest lake, and not a sea as it's name suggests, but what about the world's largest island on a lake, on an island, on a lake, on an island?</p>

<p>That title goes to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taal_Volcano#Crater_Lake_.26_Vulcan_Point">Vulcan Point</a> (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&q=Philippines&sll=23.885838,-69.609375&sspn=69.36182,82.792969&ie=UTF8&cd=1&geocode=FWmHxAAdwR9CBw&split=0&hq=&hnear=Philippines&ll=13.988376,120.989342&spn=0.303491,0.32341&z=12">see it on Google Maps</a>) in the Philippines. Treehugger has a <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/galleries/2010/01/tiny-philippine-island-is-center-of-a-crazy-but-true-natural-wonder.php">great series of zoom-in photos</a> that show you how that complicated geological title actually makes sense and how it's possible.</p>
<p>For those that couldn't be bothered, it's Vulcan Point within Crater Lake, on Taal Island within Lake Taal, on the island of Luzon.</p>
<p>Pretty amazing place this earth we live on. I think NASA are wasting their time on Mars.  Earth is way cooler.</p>
