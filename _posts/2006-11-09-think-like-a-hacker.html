<p>Woohooo!!! I think I can call myself a hacker now, or should that be HaX0R or some such.  I've just "cracked" the <a href="http://www.freestuffhotdeals.com/hacker/1.html">Hacker Puzzle</a> and it didn't take very long to crack it either.  Give it a go and let me know how you get on.  Keep going until you see the dancing granny. Don't mention the final word - we don't want to give the game away and watch out for "ojofuffo". ;-)</p>
