<p>I use <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> to pretty much run most of this site.  One of this things I've been doing for static pages, like my archives, gallery and <a href="/about/">colophon</a>, is create a new PHP file, include the header and footer code from WordPress and then fill in my own content in the middle.  This works, but is a bit of a pain in the arse to maintain.</p>
<p>Well, not for much longer... I've just discovered, via <a href="http://www.chrisjdavis.org/2005/05/26/secrets-of-wp-theming-part-1/">this</a> article,  that WordPress 1.5, and later has the ability to create "Pages" and assign custom templates etc to these pages - cool 8-).  Add in a couple of plugins and I can get my whole site running from WordPress... effectively making WordPress a complete CMS for my site.</p>
<p>Now, as I'm working this weekend, I may as well use my time to migrate my static pages across.</p>
