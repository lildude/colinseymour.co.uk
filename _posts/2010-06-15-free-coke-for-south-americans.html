<p>I think Nandos may have a few more of these up their sleeve.  Here's their advert for the Uruguayan players and fans...</p>

<p>The details are in the fine print (<a href="http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/Nandos-South-America/902076663_zpqju-X3.jpg">full size image</a> for those with bad eyes).</p>
<p>I think Nandos are getting a bit stingy though.  The <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/free-lunch-for-all-mexicans">Mexicans were offered a free lunch</a> and now our Uruguayan friends only get a can of Coke ;-) .  I wonder what they'll come up with for the French.</p>
