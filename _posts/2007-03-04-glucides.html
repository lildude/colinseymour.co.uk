<p>The French use the term "glucides" to depict carbohydrates on the side of products.  Think of the word as an English word for a moment, in a singular form and take note of the ending - "cide". Can you think of any English word that ends in "cide", other than "decide", that does NOT have any negative connotations? Could the French be onto something here?</p>
