<p>Back in 2009, Saracens thought the chances of someone kicking a rugby ball from 30 meters and hitting the crossbar were pretty slim, and then <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/what-a-way-to-win-250k" target="_blank">someone did it</a>.  In the hopes it was a one-off fluke (I'm sure they were hoping it was), they held the competition again on Boxing Day last year and you'll never believe it, some chap did it again, and also on his first kick...</p>

<p>Just as well they've got sponsorship, though if this becomes a trend, I think they may find it hard for a sponsor to stump up the cash.</p>
