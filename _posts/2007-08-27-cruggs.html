<p>There are two types of shoes I absolutely hate - <a href="https://www.uggaustralia.com/ProductsList.aspx?gID=w&categoryID=283&page=5">Ugg boots</a> and <a href="https://www.crocs.com/">Crocs</a>.  Someone thought it would be a grand idea to combine the two into what I can only assume are called "Cruggs":</p>

<p>Brilliant idea. :-/  Take two hideous types of shoes and have them make babies which are even more hideous.</p>
