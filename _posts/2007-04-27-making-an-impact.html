<p>You know you're making an impact in the world (at least the South African world) when Stephen Francis and Rico of <a href="https://www.madamandeve.com">Madam & Eve</a> start drawing cartoons around a story on your blog.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it wasn't one of my posts.  It was <a href="https://diva2b.blogspot.com/2007/04/hip-hop-issue.html">this post by ms Porcelain</a> that I stumbled upon via <a href="https://eishcoza.blogspot.com/2007/04/lets-make-difference.html">this post by Eish!!</a>.</p>
<p>Have a read through <a href="https://diva2b.blogspot.com/2007/04/hip-hop-issue.html">ms Porcelain's post</a> and then check out <a href="https://www.madamandeve.com/cartoons/me003550.gif">this weekend's Madam & Eve cartoon</a>.  Co-incidence?  I think not.</p>
