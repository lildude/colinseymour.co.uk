<p><img class="alignleft" src="/img/prontocondoms.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Pronto Condoms" />How's this for a bit of South African enginuity: super quick slick condoms brought to you by Prontocondoms out of Stellenbosch. Now you're probably wondering, what the hell am I talking about. Well, these enterprising chappies from Stellenbosch have devised a method of putting on a condom super quick without any fuss. Check out the <a href="http://www.prontocondoms.co.za/demo_mov.htm">demo</a> to see how impressively quick it is.  Now that you've seen how it all works, check out the great South African humour in two fantastic adverts, <del datetime="2006-11-01T20:14:09+00:00">using</del> mocking two of South Africa's most upstanding HIV/AIDS awareness advocates: <a href="http://www.prontocondoms.co.za/jacob.htm">Jacob [Zuma]</a> and <a href="http://www.prontocondoms.co.za/manto.htm">Manto [Tshabalala-Msimang]</a>.</p>
<p>Now there's just no excuse.</p>
