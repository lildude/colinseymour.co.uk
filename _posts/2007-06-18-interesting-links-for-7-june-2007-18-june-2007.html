<p>Interesting links for 7 June 2007 - 18 June 2007:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://new.7digital.com/">7digital.com</a> - Very cheap (50p a track), high quality (320Kbps), DRM free music, and best of accessible from any browser.  You're music is also re-downloadable AFTER you've paid for it. No more lost tracks.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.littlefashiongallery.com/shop/album_di_famiglia-furniture_accessories_toys-customizable_cardboard_cot-p-241.html?zenid=9788088af563c25c50245120d86816b5">Customizable cardboard cot</a> - I hope Fiona and Alan didn't spend a lot on a cot. These ones are cooool, if a bit expensive for a cardboard box. Maybe the wheels are gold plated or something.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,2098154,00.html">Fly Pink, a women's only airline</a> - OMG.  Whatever next.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.southafrica.info/public_services/citizens/crimeline.htm">SA's anonymous crime tip-off line</a> - What a brilliant idea.  This has the potential to have a huge impact on crime in SA.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mr-lee-catcam.de/index.htm">Mr. Lee CatCam</a> - Ever wondered what your moggy gets up to every day?  Well some German chap was, so he attached a camera to his cat's collar.  Now he knows.  Pretty cool.</li>
</ul>
