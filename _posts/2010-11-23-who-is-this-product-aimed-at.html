<p>I'm in need of a new pair of running shorts and thought I'd peruse the internet for some prices.  Whilst going through my list of sport retailer websites, I visited <a href="http://www.wiggle.co.uk" target="_blank">wiggle.co.uk</a> and on the front page I saw a <a href="http://www.wiggle.co.uk/assos-ladies-umall-s2-bib-tights/" target="_blank">product</a> portraying a mixed message...</p>
<p><img class="center" alt="Bib Tights" src="/img/BibTights.jpg" width="587" height="401" /></p>
<p>The product description certainly says it's for the laydees, but the product image is telling me something else.  Maybe the lady mannequin was on holiday on the day they took this product photo ;-) .</p>
