<p>I've said it <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/smoking-ids">before</a>: your shopping habits are being monitored by the likes of Sainsburys and Tescos whether you like it or not, and now I have proof.  </p>
<p>Claire received a parcel today from Sainsburys.  It was a Gillette Fusion razor and with it came a note that read 'as your partner is a Mach 3 user...'.</p>
<p>Now they could have been guessing, but the most probable thing is they tied the purchasing of Mach 3 razor blades with Claire's Nectar card and sent the gift.</p>
<p>Claire's waiting for the free sample of Immodium arrive with a note saying 'we've noticed that you buy loo roll every other week....' :-)</p>
