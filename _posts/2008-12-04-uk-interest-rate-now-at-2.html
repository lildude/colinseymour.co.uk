<p>Woohooo!!! The Bank of England decided to <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7764741.stm">lop off another whole 1%</a> off the base interest rates taking them down to a level not seen since 1951. Now all we need is for Nationwide to pass on the whole 1% cut, even to those with collared tracker mortgages like Claire and I have.</p>
