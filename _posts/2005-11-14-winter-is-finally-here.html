<p>After an unusually warm autumn, winter is finally here.  The trees still haven't lost all their leaves - some of which look like they only received the "autumn is here" email last week, but this morning I went down to the car to find it all iced up for the first time this year.  My car also informed me that the outside temp on the way to work was -0.5C. So, I can confirm, winter is finally here - now bring on the snow.  I want some real thick snow this year.</p>
