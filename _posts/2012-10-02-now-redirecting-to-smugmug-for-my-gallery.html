<p>In my infinite wisdom, many years ago I decided I'd write my own code to pull my photos from SmugMug, using their API, and then display then in a nice looking gallery here.  Well, not anymore.  This has worked well for a while, but I've realised I'm re-inventing the wheel unnecessarily and this re-invention is proving a nightmare to maintain.  So from now on, when you click the <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/gallery">Gallery</a> link in my header, you'll go to my public SmugMug page.</p>
