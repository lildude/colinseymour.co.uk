<p>Things have been a bit quiet here as I've been a bit busy at work, a bit pre-occupied with some other techie stuff (I can't tell you about it just yet) and generally feeling uninspired.</p>
<p>That said, you guys haven't been too forth-coming either.  I asked for people's opinion on my potential new logo and all I got was 1 comment.  I know I have at least 2 readers, so where are the rest of the comment.  Which do you prefer?</p>
