<p>I've finally had enough with my current hosting provider and their incompetence and it's time to move on.  I've spent most of the last few days moving all my files across from this host to the new one and I'll be flicking the switch some time today.  </p>
<p>Depending on where you are in the world, the change may take anywhere up to 48 hours to take effect, but it's usually quicker. You'll know when you're looking at the new server (hint: things will look different).</p>
<p>Things may be a little broken for a short while on the other side. I'm off tomorrow, so will fix any issues as I spot them.</p>
<p>See you on the other side.</p>
<p>Oh yes, please don't post comments until the move is complete.  They may get lost somewhere.</p>
