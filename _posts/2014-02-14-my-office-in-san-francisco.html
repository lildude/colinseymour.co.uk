<p><img alt="Coder Cave" class="alignright" src="/assets/coder-cave.jpg" width="300" height="450" />So I've been working for <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for just short of two months now and I'm enjoying every moment of it.  I work with great people with some of the greatest minds I've ever encountered in a very flexible and creative manner with the freedom and encouragement to do COOL THINGS™.  </p>
<p>Now one of the coolest things has got to be GitHub HQ 3.0 in San Francisco.  This has got to be the coolest office space I've ever seen and had the pleasure to work in...</p>

<p>Don't believe me? Check out the pictures and blurb in <a href="http://honorawards.squarespace.com/#/fennie-mehl-architects-studio-hatch-github-headquarters/" target="_blank">our nomination for the 2014 IIDA Northern California Honor Awards</a> and then go and vote for us, or at least the designer, <a href="http://honorawards.squarespace.com/vote-here/" target="_blank">here</a> (it's number 23).</p>
<p>I wish I could cycle the 3km I used to to get to this office every morning.</p>
