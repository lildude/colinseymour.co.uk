<p>I was very fortunate to receive the awesome <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0007IMT40?ie=UTF8&tag=costest-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B0007IMT40">Weber One Touch Gold</a> braai (BBQ) for my birthday and last weekend was a prime time to take it out for it's maiden voyage.  As it's a <em>braai</em> and not a <em>BBQ</em> in our household, the first thing to cook had to be wors (got it from <a href="http://www.biltong.co.uk">Susmans</a> along with a kilo of biltong :-p ).</p>
<p>Here's a mini-picture story for you to enjoy (select the first image and click through).</p>

<p>I left cleaning the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0007IMT40?ie=UTF8&tag=costest-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B0007IMT40">Weber</a> to the next morning as it was quite late once we'd finished eating and what a pleasure it was.  All I had to do was crumble or pick up the remain large chunks of coal, push the ashes through the vents at the bottom into the ash-catcher, remove it, empty it and it was done.  The Weber was spick-and-span in less than 10 mins.</p>
<p>All in all the Weber is a brilliant braai and I can't wait to cook up all sorts of culinary delights.  I think the ultimate goal is to cook the Christmas turkey in it like my uncle Steve did one year.</p>
