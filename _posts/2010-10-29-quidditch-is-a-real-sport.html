<p><img class="alignleft" alt="Quidditch" src="/assets/QuidditchShield.png" width="133" height="160" />Yes folks, the title is correct: Quidditch, or should that be "Muggle Quidditch" so the hardcore Harry Potter fans don't take offence, is indeed a real sport and involves a bunch of boys and girls racing around in capes and goggles with broomsticks between their legs, while shooting balls through mounted hula hoops.  Or to the layman: it's a bunch of sad geeky students running around looking daft playing a really rough version of wonky netball with a glorified twig between their legs and the occasional nutter (apparently he's the golden snitch) dashing across the field.</p>
<p>If that's not surprising enough, they have an "international" (most of the members seem to all be American) <a href="http://www.internationalquidditch.org/" target="_blank">association</a>; rules, though the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704300604575554492567311412.html" target="_blank">WSJ notes</a> these are changing this year to reduce the number of broken bones; official broom suppliers and even a world cup tournament in November, and it's not the first either. It's the fourth world cup.</p>
<p>As I'm not a Harry Potter fan, I can't say I'm too excited by the "magic" of this idea, but looking at some of the photos, I think lots of kids will be excited by this. I find it quite amusing that people would actually take a fictitious sport and turn it into a real one. Of course this does raise the question: did people have similar musings when rugby was invented?</p>
