<p>This is just a little warning note to let you know I'm working this weekend, so I'm using the time to move my site from an old server to a new one (still at the same company).  In theory you shouldn't notice anything different, but if you do, don't worry, it should all be fixed by 7pm GMT on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: If you can see this, the migration has completed. If you encounter any problems, please let me know.</p>
