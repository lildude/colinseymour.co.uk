<p>I've worked out how to cross the road in Bangalore: wait for a gap that is about a car's length and start moving aiming for that gap.  When you get into the gap, just keep walking, but pay special attention to the hooting.  If you're hooted at, you know the driver has seen you and you're safe.  If you're not hooted at: RUN as the driver hasn't seen you :-) </p>
