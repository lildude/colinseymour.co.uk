<p>Well, it seems Jacob Zuma has trashed everything two major campaigns in South Africa have fought for - Women's Rights and AIDS Education and Awareness (millions have been spent on this one).</p>
<p>Jacob Zuma was <a href="http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Zuma/0,,2-7-1840_1928961,00.html">acquitted of rape</a> in the Johannesburg High Court today.  From all the stuff he's said during the trial, he's pretty much sent out the message to all rape-inclined men; "Hey, it's ok to rape a woman if she's not wearing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jilbab">jilbÄb</a>, she IS asking for it after all."</p>
<p>And to the rest of the uneducated populous; "Moenie vret about getting HIV/AIDS, you can have a shower after you've got jiggy without a condom."</p>
<p>I know you can't throw the book at someone who's innocent (seems his accuser has a bit of a reputation for false rape claims), but I certainly think something should be done about his actions and comments.  He's just flushed millions of Rands worth of work down the loo with his bloody stupid comments.  I guess the <a href="http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Zuma/0,,2-7-1840_1929233,00.html">"tongue-lashing"</a> he received from the Judge is about as good as we can get at bashing some sort of sense into the man.</p>
