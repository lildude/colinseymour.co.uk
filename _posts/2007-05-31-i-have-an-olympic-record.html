<p>Check it out, I've got an Olympic record...</p>
<div class="flickr-srcd"><a href="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/224/522904607_374f48b52b_o.jpg"><img class="center" src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/224/522904607_011922b28a.jpg" alt="My Olympic Record" /></a></div>
<p>Ok, not really.  If I had, it would have been an exceptional achievement as I would only have been 1 at the time, and I don't think they let 1 year olds compete in the Olympics, yet. (<a href="https://www.olympics.org.uk/athleterecord.aspx?at=3651">Source</a>)</p>
