<p>Interesting links for 19 Nov 2010 - 07 Feb 2011:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.redstate.com/erick/2010/11/18/another-tsa-outrage/" target="_blank">Another TSA Outrage</a> - "This might be a good time to remind everyone that approximately 233 people re-boarded that plane with assault rifles, pistols, and machine guns - but nothing that could have been used as a weapon." - I'm glad the UK border police haven't reached these levels of stupidity.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.southafrica.info/business/economy/infrastructure/pothole-brigade.htm" target="_blank">Pothole repair, South African style</a> - What a great, quick, efficient and cost-effective way to repair potholes. Now who's going to sell this to the UK - our roads are terrible after all the snow.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/dubai/8271643/The-World-is-sinking-Dubai-islands-falling-into-the-sea.html" target="_blank">The World is sinking: Dubai islands 'falling into the sea'</a> - Well, that's hardly a surprise.  Just as well they haven't developed on all the island yet else they'll be disappearing into the ocean too.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/bbc-bans-the-word-reform-in-debate-over-voting-reform-2192455.html" target="_blank">BBC bans the word 'reform' in debate over voting reform - News, TV & Radio - The Independent</a> - Huh? What?  Oh ok, if you insist.  We'll call it "that thing" instead.  Good for you?</li>
</ul>
