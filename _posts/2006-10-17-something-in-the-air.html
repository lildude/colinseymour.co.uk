<p>There seems to be something in the air at the moment.  <strong>NONE</strong> of my customers seem to be able to bloody well read what I send to them.  I've had 5 customers this morning already who've either not sent me what I've requested, not done what I've requested or even sent me information I didn't ask for, and don't really want. I've even had a customer send me info that isn't even related to the problem I'm dealing with. I think SpecSavers need to introduce a proactive service. I've got a list of potential customers for them already.</p>
