<p>A while ago, I mentioned that Google <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/google-cant-subtract">couldn't do basic subtraction</a>, well a new dynamic online calculator, <a href="http://calcr.com/">Calcr</a>, suffers from the same problem.</p>
<p>Once again, enter <code>1 - 0.9 - 0.1</code> and press enter.  Not the answer you were expecting, is it? (<a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/gallery/album/screenshots/photo/calcr-cant-subtract/">Screenshot</a> for the archives).</p>
<p>If you're curious, Google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=1+-+0.9+-+0.1">can now</a> do this simple calculation.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Calcr are even kind enough to suggest another tool - <a href="http://www.calcoolate.com">Calcoolate</a>, but it too suffers from the same problem. (<a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/gallery/album/screenshots/photo/calcoolate-cant-subtract/">Screenshot</a> for the archives).</p>
