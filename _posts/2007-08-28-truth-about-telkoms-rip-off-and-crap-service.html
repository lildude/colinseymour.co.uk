<p>Living in South Africa? Ever had that feeling that Telkom were ripping you off?  Ever wondered why Telkom has had such a long run without any competition and without any true expansion or improvement in the infrastructure?  </p>
<p>Well, check out <a href="http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3998638">this article on Business Report</a>.  </p>
<p>It appears when the government sold a 30% stake in Telkom, they effectively made Telkom and the purchaser of the 30% stake exempt of South African law.</p>
<p>So now you know why South African's were paying some of the highest prices in the world without actually seeing anything for their money.  They were lining the pockets of some fat cats who didn't even live in the country, and thus weren't affected by their poor investment.</p>
