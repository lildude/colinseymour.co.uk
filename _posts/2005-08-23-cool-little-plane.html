<p>How's this for a cool tiny little radio control plane?  It weighs in at only 4 grams and is fully remote control.  Now you can fly planes when the weather is crap too - in your lounge instead of out in the rain.  I wouldn't want to take this outside - one sneeze and it's gone, but it looks great fun.  Full details can be found <a href="http://www.plantraco.com/hobbies/product_butterfly.html">here</a> and a little video showing how it works is <a href="http://plantraco.com/hobbies/butterflyvideo3.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Another possible entry on your christmas list Steve?</p>
