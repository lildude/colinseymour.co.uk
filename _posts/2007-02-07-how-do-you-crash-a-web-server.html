<p>Simple... issue a severe weather warning forecasting a <em>whopping</em> 2 - 5cm of snow (some places may get more).</p>
<p>Yup, you guessed it.  The <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/">Met Office</a> thought it would be a good idea to let the whole of Britain know that getting work tomorrow is going to be a right pain in the arse (mainly due to the average public services' in-ability to deal with anything other than about 10mm of rain).</p>
<p>Naturally everyone thought they'd go and check the Met Office website just to make sure they weren't hearing things and now we get this:</p>

<p>What I find amazing is the UK issues a severe weather warning for a mere 2 - 5cm of snow.  You'd kind of hope the UK could cope with this insignificant amount of snow with ease - it is in northern Europe, where snow does occur, after all. Actually, come to think of it... it's probably so that all the stupid drivers don't even bother getting out of bed tomorrow morning - it saves lives and insurance.</p>
