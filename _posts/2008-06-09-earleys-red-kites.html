<p>You don't want to be a rodent in Earley/Wokingham at the moment.  We've currently got a lovely pair of red kites in the area.  I'm not sure where they are nesting, but I've seen them circling for several weeks now and even saw one go "in for the kill" - came up empty handed though - on Wokingham road near The George pub a couple of weeks ago. Unfortunately I didn't have my camera with me, but it was pretty amazing.</p>

<p>I managed to grab these two great pics yesterday afternoon (click for larger image).  I think they were enjoying the sunshine as much as we were.  Unfortunately the quality isn't brilliant as my poor lens was operating at full zoom.  The pics are pretty impressive none-the-less.</p>
