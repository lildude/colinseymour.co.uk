<p>My respect for the BBC is starting to wain.  This morning, the news was all about how WiFi '<em>may</em>' <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/6674675.stm">kill me</a> (I like to exaggerate - it connects with The Sun readers better ;-) ).  Now this afternoon <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6676129.stm">it's not</a>. Make up your mind.</p>
