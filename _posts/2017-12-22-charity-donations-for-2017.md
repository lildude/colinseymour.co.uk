Christmas is fast approaching and so it's a good time to do my annual charity donations which my employer will match, up to $1500.

This year, I've split my $1500 equally between:

- [Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/)  
  **Why?** Mental health issues have plagued my family my entire life and the older and wiser I get, the more I realise our minds (aka the brain) are the most powerful organs in our bodies and accordingly, I think we need to spend a lot more time and money on researching, protecting and enhancing our minds.
- [Starfish Greathearts Foundation](https://www.starfishcharity.org/)  
  **Why?** Starfish cares for vulnerable and orphaned children affected by HIV and poverty in South Africa. I'd love to be able to donate to more South African causes, but very few have any sort of charity presence in the UK making it inefficient for both them and me. Starfish is one of those I believe in and can contribute to from the UK.
- [GoodGym](https://www.goodgym.org/)  
  **Why?** I first heard about GoodGym on [episode 399 of the MarathonTalk podcast](https://marathontalk.com/shows/episode-399-ivo-gormley/) and thought this was a brilliant idea. Essentially, runners combine going for a run with helping out their local community, whether that be dropping the paper off to Mr Jones at #45, having a cuppa with Dr Bob next door, or mowing the lawn for Mrs Smith across town. There isn't a GoodGym "collective" in my area yet so I can't contribute with my legs and time, but I'm more than happy to contribute with my ðŸ’° until then.
- [Macmillan Cancer Support](https://www.macmillan.org.uk/)  
  **Why?** I'm technically a cancer survivor - I had a malignant melanoma removed from my arm - and these peeps were very supportive, without me even needing it, when I first received my melanoma diagnosis. Cancer research is fantastic, and I donated to them last yet, but right now I'm feeling support is more important as it ties back to the mind and overall wellbeing over a person. Great support == better mind == feel better == conquer the world.
- [CoppaFeel!](https://coppafeel.org/)  
  **Why?** Do I really need to explain this to you ðŸ˜‰
- [Launchpad Reading](https://www.launchpadreading.org.uk/)  
  **Why?** Launchpad is a homeless support charity that helps some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people in my local town, Reading. Unlike the other charities I've supported, this one is local and I can and have seen them in action.
