<p>It was just over a year ago that I <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/disability">commented about a sign</a> outside the Spar in Olivedale and came up with the idea of printing some nice big yellow stickers like this:</p>
<p><img class="centered" src="https://photos22.flickr.com/32842565_bf7de41b65.jpg" alt="Inconsiderate Driver Sticker" title="Inconsiderate Driver Sticker" /></p>
<p>... to stick on the cars of inconsiderate drivers.</p>
<p>Well, someone has pretty much come up with the <a href="http://iparklikeanidiot.com">same idea</a> and actually put it into motion and created the stickers.  His stickers are a little simpler (smaller words) and probably better understood by the fools who can't park:</p>

<p>I think I need to order a 100-pack for all the stupid arses I encounter, particularily one lovely blue car (which would become yellow and black once I've had my fun) that can't seem to park in the road outside our flat. </p>
