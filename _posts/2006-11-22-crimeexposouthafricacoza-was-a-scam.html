<p>Well well well, it seems a website, CrimeExpoSouthAfrica.co.za, that was a hot topic of discussion amongst fellow South Africans (<a href="http://wozafriday.com/2006/07/07/land-of-sin/">Wozafriday</a> / <a href="http://www.cherryflava.com/cherryflava/2006/06/grootbos_privat.html">Cherryflava</a>) on the blogosphere, newspapers and news sites sites (<a href="http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_1959605,00.html">News24</a> / <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/5157614.stm">BBC</a>) in July, was nothing but a scam.</p>
<p>The Citizen newspaper did a bit of investigating and discovered a lot of inconsistencies about the website and it's "owner" - Neil Watson.  Since these findings were published, the website has gone and it seems so has "Neil Watson" and all the donations and money he may have made from this site (<a href="http://iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=13&art_id=iol1164192268745C651">IOL</a>).</p>
