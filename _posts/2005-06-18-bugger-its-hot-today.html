What a day it is today... nice and clear and boiling hot.  28C.  It too hot to go outside without breaking into a sweat at the drop of a hat.  Lets hope we've got a whole summer of these lovely hot days... now I'm just praying its nice and cool this evening, else we'll never get any sleep.</p>
<p>Oh, if you're wondering why it says Bracknell - it's cos that's the closet "Met Office" to us.</p>
