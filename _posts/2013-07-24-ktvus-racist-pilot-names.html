<p>This is a little late as I've been away on holiday, but it's so unbelievable, racist and true that I have to post it in case you missed it.  </p>
<p>On 12 July 2013, San Francisco's KTVU reported that these were the names of the pilots of Asiana Flight 214 that crashed on Sunday [7 July 2013]...</p>

<p>Of course they issued an apology but the best bit... they went on to blame an intern:</p>
<blockquote><p>An NTSB spokesperson <a href="https://blog.sfgate.com/matierandross/2013/07/12/1937/" target="_blank">told SFGate</a> that 'the names 'originated at the media outlet' and that the intern — unaware of the offensive names — was 'acting in good faith and trying to be helpful.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think blaming an intern is the easy way out... I can't believe this wasn't picked up before it aired.</p>
