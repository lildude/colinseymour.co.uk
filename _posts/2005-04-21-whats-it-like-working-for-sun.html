<p>I've been asked this question a couple of times and have come up with my own explanations, but none are anywhere near as good as the way another Sun employee put it in on his blog in a post titled "<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/gameguy/20050418#sex_at_ibm_and_sun">Sex at IBM and Sun</a>"... oh and contrary to the title, it's got nothing to do with sex.</p>
