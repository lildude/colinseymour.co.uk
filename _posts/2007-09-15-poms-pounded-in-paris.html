Oh dear.  I think someone forgot to tell the English that they need to actually score points to face any chance of retaining the Webb Ellis Trophy. </p>
<p>South Africa completely out classed England last night. They seized opportunities when they arose, kicked with precision and defended flawlessly.  I'm sure there were a couple of nightmares about the Great Green Wall in the English camp when they all tucked in for the night.  The SA defense was that solid.</p>
<p>Go Bokke!!! </p>
