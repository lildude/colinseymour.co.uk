<p>I've finally found the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/05/19/mrsa_antibiotic/">real reason</a> I don't get sick very often... it's from all the soil I ate voluntarily (as an inquisitive hungry toddler) and involuntarily (stuck at the bottom of a "pile-on") as a kid living in South Africa.  A quote from the article:- <em>"A compound isolated from South African soil samples offers potency against all the big hospital killers."</em> That explains a lot.</p>
