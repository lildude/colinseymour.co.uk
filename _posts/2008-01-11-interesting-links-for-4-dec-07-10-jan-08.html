<p>Interesting links for 4 Dec 07 - 10 Jan 08:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/10/elephant_petition/">Government rejects elephants for pets e-petition</a> - Killjoys!!! I was quite keen on being able to have a little bit of Africa in my back garden (when I get one.  A garden that is).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.24.com/news/?p=tsa&i=809759">Man's death unnoticed for a year</a> - Wow!! A whole year before anyone missed him. He must has really smelt by then</li>
<li><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7174760.stm">Clarkson stung after bank prank</a> - Now we can make fun of Jeremy Clarkson.  This certainly wasn't a wise move by him, and I certainly hope he's learnt from it.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reghardware.co.uk/2007/12/27/massive_vodafone_uk_mobile_data_bill/">Man uses mobe as modem, rings up &pound;27k phone bill</a> - Not only doesn't someone have far too much money and not enough common sense, but he's got a hell of a lot of free time.  Downloading all that data must have taken forever.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.military.com/NewsContent/0,13319,159067,00.html">Britain Drops 'War on Terror' Label</a> - Finally someone has seen sense in Whitehall.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/consumer/orl-geeklights2307dec23,0,2223946.story?coll=orl_tab01_layout">Taking lights to the extreme</a> - Now this is called taking Christmas lights to extreme.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nextenergynews.com/news1/next-energy-news-toshiba-micro-nuclear-12.17b.html">Toshiba Builds 100x Smaller Micro Nuclear Reactor</a> - I can picture these becoming very popular in South Africa if Eskom continue their "load shedding" (that's turning off the power to certain parts of the grid for those who don't know).</li>
<li><a href="https://petitions.pm.gov.uk/databreaches/">Petition to: require all organisations notify customers immediately of any personal data security breaches.</a> - If you're in the UK, you may want to sign this petition on the PM's website.  At the moment gov and private orgs don't need to notify the public of any personal data loss.  In the US they must. This petition is calling for a similar law in the UK.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=13&art_id=vn20071217045255591C260701">Tough new sex law means no more teen kisses</a> - SA prisons are going to be fully of horny little teenagers with the introduction of the new Sexual Offences Act. I wonder if and how they plan on policing this.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,2225434,00.html">McParking row as slow eaters given heavy fines</a> - Here's another reason by Maccy Ds isn't good for you.  That 99p burger may end up costing you &pound;125.99</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=499453&in_page_id=1770">Abandoned baby hedgehogs are too weak to hibernate</a> - If they're all as cute as the one in green, they can live with us.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSN1529462220071116?pageNumber=1">Chevy Hybrid SUV wins Green Car of Year</a> - You've got to be kidding.  I can't even get this kind of economy in my car, even if I rev the nuts off it continually.  How on earth is 22mpg GOOD?  I average somewhere between 40mpg and 45mpg. Now that's green for a petrol engine (no hybrid).</li>
