<p><a href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/index.php?id=166">Gaim 2 Beta 2 is out</a> now.  I've just downloaded it and looky looky, my name is now in the list of contributors:</p>
<pre lang="text">
          $ grep Colin gaim-2.0.0beta2/COPYRIGHT
          Colin Seymour
          $
</pre>
<p>If I've got time tomorrow, I'll see if I can get this compiled on Solaris 10.  I know it won't compile with SunStudio due to a bug I've still got to work out how to solve, but it should compile with GCC.</p>
