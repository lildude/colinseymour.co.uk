<p>How's this for an ingenious method of turning a teeny weeny single room flat in Hong Kong into a 24 "room" flat with the aid of a couple of rails, wheels and shelving units...</p>

<p>This is a brilliant use of the space you've got, but lets just hope developers in London don't cotton onto this idea any time soon.  They'll be charging a bomb for a <em>modern 24-room apartment</em> at the blink of an eye.  Actually, come to think of it, I'm surprised IKEA don't already sell this concept flat-packed.</p>
