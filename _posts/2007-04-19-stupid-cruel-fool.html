<p><a href="http://www.24.com/news/?p=tsa&i=489968">Finding a picture of your pooch's severed head in a national newspaper</a> is quite a shocking way to find out what happened to poor little fluffy, but the part I find amazing is the stooopid idiot (the lady's grandson) who did it, gave the correct sender details (his details) when he attempted to post the head to someone else. Genius boetie. Genius!!</p>
