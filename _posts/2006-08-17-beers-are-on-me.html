<p>Just a short post to say Claire and I are heading down to South Africa for a well deserved holiday on Saturday.  We've got a busy schedule schlepping from one side of the country to the other, but if you want to meet up for a couple of beers somewhere, <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/colophon/#contact">drop me a line</a> and I'm sure we can make a plan -  I'm buying.</p>
