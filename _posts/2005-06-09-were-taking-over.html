<p>I was reading one of the SA news sites I read and found an interesting <a href="https://www.sadirectory.co.uk/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=144">article</a> about South African's in London. It seems we're the most successful of all the immigrants in London, primarily due to being the best educated and employed of all of London's 7 million immigrants.</p>
<p>One thing I didn't realise, is Wimbledon seems to be the London suburb for all the Saffers.  I haven't been to Wimbledon, but I guess I'm going to have to go see what all the hype is about.</p>
<p>Now, I wonder if there's a biltong shop in Wimbledon?</p>
