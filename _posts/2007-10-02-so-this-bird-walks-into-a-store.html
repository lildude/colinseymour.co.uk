<p><img class="alignleft" src="/img/seagull.gif" alt="Seagull Thief" />I'm sure you may have received this by email already, if not, check it out... A seagull in Scotland has developed the habit of stealing chips from a neighborhood shop.</p>
<p>The seagull waits until the shopkeeper isn't looking, and then walks into the store and grabs a snack-size bag of cheese Doritos.</p>
<p>Once outside, the bag gets ripped open and shared by other birds.</p>
<p>The seagull's shoplifting started early this month when he first swooped into the store in Aberdeen, Scotland, and helped himself to a bag of chips. Since then, he's become a regular. He always takes the same type of chips.</p>
<p>Customers have begun paying for the seagull's stolen bags of chips because they think it's so funny.  </p>
