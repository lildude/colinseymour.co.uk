I'm definately missing out on some good ol' South African advertising.  <a href="http://www.nandos.co.za/">Nandos (In SA)</a> are at it again with another fantastic <a href="http://venus.biz-community.com/c/article/7602_1.mpg">advert</a> (thanks <a href="http://www.joblog.co.za/2005/08/well_hung_and_e.html">JoBlog</a>).  It's probably a bit crass and "in-your-face" for the UK market, but absolutely brilliant.  Come to think of it, it's "unpopularity" with the UK market would be exactly what they want and would certainly get them talked about in every home - yes, it's surprising to think some people in the UK, <strong>still</strong> haven't heard of Nandos, despite all the cricket advertising.</p>
