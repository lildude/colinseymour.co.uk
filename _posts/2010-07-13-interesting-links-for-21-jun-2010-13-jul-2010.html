<p>Interesting links for 21 Jun 2010 - 13 Jul 2010:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_15338527?nclick_check=1">In California, license plates might go electronic - San Jose Mercury News</a> - Adverts today, full TV programs tomorrow.  And just think of the fun hackers could have with these things.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.southafrica.info/2010/football-last-man-300610.htm">World record for SA football fan</a> - Now that's called dedication.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/07/06/w00t-sends-associate.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+boingboing%2FiBag+%28Boing+Boing%29&utm_content=Google+Reader">W00t! sends Associated Press a bill for quoting its blog - Boing Boing</a> - I love it when these press companies who are so keen on making money off everyone and anyone find themselves at the butt-end of their own "measures".</li>
<li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/jul/06/caster-semenya-iaaf-clearance">Caster Semenya may return to track this month after IAAF clearance</a> - This is great news for Caster Semenya.  Pity someone leaked the story in the first place.  Being subject to gender verification is a highly personal and potentially devastating experience that only the immediately involved should know about. But in this ever invasive news world we live in, cash speaks volumes.</li>
<li><a href="http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/local/san_francisco&id=7549993#&cmp=twi-kgo-article-7549993">Bottled water ban considered at events on San Francisco property</a> - I think San Francisco may be onto something here. SF today, the world tomorrow.</li>
