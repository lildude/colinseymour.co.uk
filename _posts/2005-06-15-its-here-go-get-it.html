<p><strong>IT'S FINALLY HERE</strong>... <a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun Microsystems</a> has now officially released OpenSolaris to the world.  Go checkout the <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org">OpenSolaris</a> website or the <a href="http://www.sun.com/opensolaris">http://www.sun.com/opensolaris</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will be a turning point for what is probably the most advanced OS in the world.  Hopefully, the developer community will grab this with both hands and get all those Linux applications running on OpenSolaris without any hitches and drive OpenSolaris and Solaris into some of those places the Linux and Windows currently occupy.  Who knows, 5 years from now, people may be using OpenSolaris on their home PC's.</p>
<p>Now, all I need is some time to play with this myself - think I'll start off doing some advertising.  Need to finish copying my music across from my PC to my Mac too.</p>
