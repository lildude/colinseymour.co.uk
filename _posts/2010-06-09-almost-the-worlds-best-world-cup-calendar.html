<p>This has got to be the most impressive World Cup 2010 calendar thingy I've seen so far for the world cup that starts on Friday: <a href="https://www.marca.com/deporte/futbol/mundial/sudafrica-2010/calendario-english.html">Marca.com's Interactive 2010 World Cup Calendar</a>...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.marca.com/deporte/futbol/mundial/sudafrica-2010/calendario-english.html" target="_blank"><img class="center" alt="Almost the Best World Cup Calendar in the World" src="/img/BestWorldCupCalendar.jpg" width="550" height="466" /></a></p>
<p>It's pretty impressive and makes those magazine/newspaper pullouts and every free iPhone app I've seen look silly.</p>
<p>I've prefixed the title of this post with "Almost" because the only downfall is it's in Flash. I'd have been blown over if this was done using HTML5, CSS and Javascript, but that's just the techie in me.</p>
