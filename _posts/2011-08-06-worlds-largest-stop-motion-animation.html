<p>The guys at Aardman, specifically the <a href="http://www.aardman.com/commercials/directors/sumo-science/" target="_blank">Sumo Science</a> chappies, have come up with another great animation: Gulp</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ieN2vhslTTU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This is a stop motion video filmed at Pendine Beach in South Wales on a set covering 11 000 square feet using a crane, a lot of helping hands and three Nokia N8 mobile phones.</p>
<p>Pretty impressive stuff.  If you're curious about the making of this video, be sure to click the "Watch the Making Of Here" text towards the end of the video.</p>
