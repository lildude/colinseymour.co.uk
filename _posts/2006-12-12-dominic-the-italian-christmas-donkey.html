<p>It's that time of year again where anyone and everyone who can broadcast music will be blasting out Christmas songs for everyone to hear. You'll hear the golden oldies you grew up with and then the same song again, but this time sung by a modern artist or group, just in case you hadn't heard it the first time. </p>
<p>After working in retail for several years where I was forced to endure hours upon hours of non-stop Christmas music, I have to admit I'm not the biggest fan.  Play them on the 24th, 25th and 26th, but that's it; I don't want to hear any more.</p>
<p>However, there is one song that is quite cute, always makes me smile, and is very very rarely played (unless you listen to Chris Moyles on Radio 1) which is a shame.  It's quite an old song from 1967 by Lou Monte and it's called "Dominic the Italian Christmas Donkey".</p>
<p>Have a listen, and I guarantee you'll have this tune in your head for the rest of the day.  Enjoy.</p>

<p>Update: Just realised I forgot to re-enable the plugin so you could play the song.  It's all working now.</p>
