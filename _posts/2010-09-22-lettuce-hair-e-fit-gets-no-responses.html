<p>Believe it or not, Hampshire police are surprised that they've <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-11388538" target="_blank">had no calls from the public</a> after issuing the following e-fit of a man who robbed an old lady of Â£60:</p>

<p>Apparently, he's NOT a bald man wearing lettuce leaves as the e-fit would lead you to believe. This is apparently a problem with the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-11380834" target="_blank">"hair" functionality of their e-fit programme</a>. </p>
<p>Indeed it's a problem with their e-fit programme: the face is drawn by a computer and the hair is filled in later by a 5 year old with crayons.</p>
