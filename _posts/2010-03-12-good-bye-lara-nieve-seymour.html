<p><strong>Little Snowdrop</strong><br />
The world may never notice if a snowdrop doesn't bloom,<br />
Or even pause to wonder if the petals fall too soon.<br />
But every life that ever forms, or ever comes to be,<br />
Touches the world in some small way for all eternity.<br />
The little one we longed for was swiftly here and gone.<br />
But the love that was then planted is a light that still shines on.<br />
And though our arms are empty, our hearts know what to do.<br />
Every beating of our hearts says that we all love you.</p>
<p>Rest in peace little bear.  We love and miss you so much.</p>
