<p>Do people actually listen to voicemail?  As a company policy, we must setup our voicemail on a daily basis, state our name, company, the date and if we're going to be away from our desk or are working odd hours.  </p>
<p>When I work shifts, particularly late shifts, like this week, I set my voicemail the night before, just before I go home and state my hours for the following day.</p>
<p>Well, this morning I come in and one customer decided to phone 5, yes <strong>5</strong>, times between 9:08 and 10:55. Apparently he then got quite irate because I wasn't answering my phone.  Well duh doofus... if you had listened to my voicemail message you would have known I wasn't going to be in until 13:30 and as a result, I wasn't going to answer the damn phone a minute before. You'd also have learnt that you could have pressed 0 at any time and gone through to someone else.</p>
<p>Oh, and don't get me onto useless voicemail messages.  This is a typical example of what I get on a day to day basis (click image for full size):</p>
