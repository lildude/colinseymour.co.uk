<p>Took the plunge yesterday and finally ordered my Mac Mini.  Got confirmation of the order this morning. All I've got to do now is order the additional memory from Crucial and the cool new monitor I want to go with.</p>
<p><strong>[Update:] </strong>Received an email last night telling that due to high demand, my expected shipping date has shifted from 11 May to 18 May. Sniff :-(</p>
