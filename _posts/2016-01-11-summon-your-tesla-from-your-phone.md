Yesterday I was discussing how Teslas can be upgraded over-the-air and the new automation features like AutoPilot that are slowly being added via incremental updates.  I jokingly said that you'd soon be able to whistle for your car in a sort of "Here boy" way and it'll come running like your faithful dog.  Imagine my surprise when I read this this morning...

> Using Summon, once you arrive home and exit Model S or Model X, you can prompt it to do the rest: open your garage door, enter your garage, park itself, and shut down. In the morning, you wake up, walk out the front door, and summon your car. It will open the garage door and come to greet you. More broadly, Summon also eliminates the burden of having to squeeze in and out of tight parking spots. During this Beta stage of Summon, we would like customers to become familiar with it on private property. Eventually, your Tesla will be able to drive anywhere across the country to meet you, charging itself along the way. It will synch with your calendar to know exactly when to arrive.

I want a Tesla even more.  My colleague took it one step further...

If that became possible, that would be substantiation alone for getting a Tesla Model S :grin:.
