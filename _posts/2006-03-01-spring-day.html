<p>In South Africa, we always used to celebrate Spring Day on 1 September by being allowed to go to school in civies (usually shorts, T-shirt and slip-slops) provided we took a buck or two or tinned food for the poor.  Applying a bit of logic, ie add 6 months because the seasons are reversed, that would make today spring day.</p>
<p>Well, it certainly is nice and sunny today, but I wouldn't even contemplate wearing shorts and slip-slops today; it was -2C whilst I was scraping the ice off my windscreen this morning.</p>
<p>I'm probably miles off spring day in the UK, but no one really acknowledges it here.  </p>
<p>Anyway, it's spring day to me, and St David's day for the Welsh.</p>
