<p>Interesting links for 27 July 2007 - 6 August 2007:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.adelaider.com/google-cheat-sheet/">Google Cheat Sheet (Version 1.06)</a> - I like to think I'm a bit of a Google power user, I just can't always remember all the keywords etc.  Now I don't need to.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.southafrica.info/what_happening/sports/sa-golf-020807.htm">First golf estate for Soweto</a> - I can just picture the Polaris World adverts now: "Fancy a game of golf whilst catching up on post-apartheid South Africa?  Well, then we at Polaris World have just the course for you starting from a fantastic price of &pound;200 000".</li>
<li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6923577.stm">Gene for left-handedness is found</a> - Ooo, just better watch me for some of the associated side effects of this lucky gene.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mg.co.za/zapiro/imagePage.aspx?YearId=2007%7CMonthId=7%7CDayId=26">The New Tour de France Route : Zapiro</a> - The current Tour de France scandal brilliantly protrayed by Zapiro again in the form of a new route.</li>
<li><a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/conservatives/story/0,,2133325,00.html">Insane donor 'rational to give to Tories'</a> - What a way to leave all your money to someone else. If this guy left the money to Labour, he'd be made a Knight-in-absentia.</li>
</ul>
