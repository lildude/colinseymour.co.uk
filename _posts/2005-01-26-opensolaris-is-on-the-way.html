<p>Sun has been touting about releasing an open source version of Solaris for ages, and it finally appears the ball is starting to roll.  The <a href="https://www.opensolaris.org">OpenSolaris</a> page is now available for people to start visiting, but unfortunately the source code for OpenSolaris 10 isn't available for download just yet (due in Q2/2005).  However, they have made the code for DTrace available. Simply put, DTrace is a cool program that allows someone to pick apart the inner workings of Solaris, or an application running on Solaris, all in real-time without the need for a specially compiled kernel - it used the bog standard Solaris 10 kernel.  More info can be found on the <a href="https://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/dtrace/">DTrace page</a> on <a href="https://www.sun.com/bigadmin/">BigAdmin</a>.</p>
<p>I think the best analogy as to what DTrace does is summed up by Alan DuBoff, one of Sun's x86 kernel developers.  He was quoted (not 100% correctly though) in a recent <a href="https://news.com.com/Sun+to+release+first+OpenSolaris+tidbit+Tuesday/2100-7344_3-5548394.html?tag=nefd.top">article</a> posted on <a href="https://https://news.com.com">https://news.com.com</a> for saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>DTrace is like being in a nudist colony, there are no secrets - not even for Solaris.</p></blockquote>
<p>How's that for an analogy for an highly technical program. 8-)</p>
