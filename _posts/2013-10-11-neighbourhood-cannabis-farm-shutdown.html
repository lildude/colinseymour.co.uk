<p>I noticed a van load of policemen on our road when I came home from my run. Just looked out now to see them carting out tons of cannabis bushes and big bags of who knows what else. Bit disappointed I missed out on all the action, but at least our neighbourhood is a little better. The air now has an interesting whiff to it too ;-)</p>
