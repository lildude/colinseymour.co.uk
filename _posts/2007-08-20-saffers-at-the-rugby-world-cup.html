<p>I've been saying it for a long time now, South Africans are taking over the world.  We're popping up in your doctor's rooms (in the white coats), pharmacies (again, in the white coats), aeroplanes (flying the planes), boardrooms (controlling the show), tech support desks (like me), butchers and more and more on the sports field. </p>
<p>This year's rugby world cup is no exception with a whopping 10 South African born players, playing for other countries, and another 16 players connected to South Africa in some way. You can see full details of these 26 players in the article by <a href="http://www.southafrica.info/what_happening/sports/sa-rugby-200807.htm">SouthAfrica.info</a>.</p>
<p>Pretty amazing how one country can have such a far reaching effect in the world of rugby.</p>
<p>On a slightly different note, I think a southern hemisphere team will snap up the trophy this year.  Yes, I'm biased towards South Africa, however we can't count out Australia, New Zealand or even Argentina.  All 4 teams are currently in the middle of their local rugby season, so these teams should be coming into the world cup strong and match fit.</p>
<p>Now I've said that, I'll probably be proven wrong with a minor team like Canada romping home with the trophy. :-)</p>
