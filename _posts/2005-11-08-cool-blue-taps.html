<p>Damn damn damn!!!  I wish we'd waited just a little bit longer before doing up the bathroom, we could have been a bit more selective in our choice of taps then.  These new blue LED faucets for taps would look soooooo cool in our bathroom. The <a href="http://www.thingsyouneverknew.com/website/store/product_detail.asp?UID=2005101906515753&item%5Fno=80875&keyword=F1JS&cat%5Fkeyword=F1JS&search%5Fpage%5Fno=3">website</a> selling these has the best description of it... <em>Running water activates this LED Faucet Light turning the water a bright blue. Turn off the water and out goes the light. It's great for getting the little ones to wash their hands, perfect for running the water in the middle of the night, and just a hoot anytime.</em></p>
<p>Count me as one of the little ones... I'd be washing my hands in the dark at every opportunity.</p>
