<p><img class="alignright" src="/img/chiliboyralepelle.jpg" alt="Chiliboy Ralepelle" />South Africa's game against the World XV on Sunday will mark another day in the history of South African rugby; <a href="https://www.news24.com/News24/Sport/Rugby/0,9294,2-9-838_2037706,00.html">Chiliboy Ralepelle has been named as captain</a> for the match.  This makes him the first black Boks XV captain, AND the youngest at only 20.  Whilst this doesn't count as an official cap (cos games against "World" teams never do) and he'll probably hand over the captaincy at half time, it certainly does give us an idea of things to come.  </p>
<p>Chiliboy has already proven he's capable by captaining the SA U21 team into the finals of IRB U21 World Championship and has been tipped as a future Boks XV captain.  Lets hope he takes this opportunity and shines.  </p>
<p>Who knows, maybe we'll see him captaining SA to the World Cup finals in Paris next year - I can just picture the miffed dutchies having to take orders from him.  Brilliant!!!!</p>
