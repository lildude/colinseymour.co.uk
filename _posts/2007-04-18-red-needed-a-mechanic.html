<p>Well, it seems Red did need a mechanic after all.  Whatever <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/who-needs-a-mechanic-anyway">I did to get Red going 3 weeks ago</a>, become undone yesterday morning on Claire's way to work.  Luckily she was right by a garage and they kindly took Red in and gave her a nice new alternator. Red's back on the road.</p>
