<p>Interesting links for 2 Oct 07 - 18 Oct 07:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://asunews.asu.edu/20071016_earlyhumans">ASU team detects earliest modern humans</a> - ... and they found then in South Africa.  So now everyone has a South African relative in their family tree ;-).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/09/amazon_outrage/">Amazon punts "special" beads to UK kiddies</a> - NSFW: See what Amazon are now selling to kiddies in the UK.  It's a bargin too with used prices starting at &pound;2.99. This is brilliant. Take note of the item description and "by". This made me laugh like a drain.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/10/05/appendix.purpose.ap/index.html">Purpose of appendix believed found</a> - Now we know.  Your appendix is there as a "break glass in case of emergency" device for your gut. I guess we won't be needing those useless probiotic yogurts anymore.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.williamhundley.com/stream.html">William Hundley - Photographer</a> - This guy's pictures are really cool.  He gets people to drap a sheet over themselves and then jump.  He captures the shot whilst the person is in the air.  The result is quite amazing.</li>
<li><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7021647.stm">Phonecalls and texts to be logged</a> - I guess VoIP in the UK is suddenly going to get a lot more popular after this law was introduced. The Brits don't like their data being recorded, and whilst the actual call won't be recorded (yet), they won't like what is.</li>
</ul>
