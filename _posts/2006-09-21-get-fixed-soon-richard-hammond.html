<p><img class="alignright" src="/assets/RichardHammond.jpg" alt="Richard Hammond" />If you've been reading or watching the news, I'm sure you'll have heard about the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/5365676.stm">accident</a> Top Gear's Richard Hammond was involved in yesterday.  For those who don't know, he was attempting to break the British landspeed record during a recording for <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/">Top Gear</a>.  Apparently he managed to break the record and then was doing another run for some more material for the show. It was during this run, at about 280mph (~450kph), that things went wrong.</p>
<p>Now at this speed, you're bound to get hurt if something goes wrong, but I can't say I agree with how the news stories report it - they all say he's "critically <em>ill</em>".  No he's not, he's "critically <strong>injured</strong>".  He doesn't have a runny nose, or some bacterial or viral infection - he's got broken bones and scrapes and scratches.  Last time I checked, that was called an "injury" not an "illness".  </p>
<p>Anyway, I really hope Richard recovers well and comes back just as strong and plucky as he was before, maybe just a little wary of such insane speeds. You just know that if he does, that accident will be on Top Gear and they'll make it look pretty damn awesome too.</p>
