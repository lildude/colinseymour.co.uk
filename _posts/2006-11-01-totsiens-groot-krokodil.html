<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PW_Botha">PW Botha</a>, one of the staunchest apartheid advocates and ex-prime ministers/presidents of South Africa, <a href="https://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_2023505,00.html">has popped his clogs</a> at the ripe old age of 90. Not a bad innings.</p>

<p>I don't remember much about this guy other than he was the head of state in South Africa for the first 10 years of my life, and I remember seeing him bellowing and wagging his finger on TV. But one thing I do know: whether you love him or hate him, he has played a part in South Africa's colourful history, and thanks to the likes of him and his cronies, apartheid must be the most well known Afrikaans word after aardvark.</p>
