<p>Sometimes you stumble upon some of the craziest stuff on YouTube.  </p>
<p>Last month I discovered this pretty amazing and is insane video of Jeb Corliss base jumping in a bat-wing-like suit...</p>

<p>I bet the adrenaline buzz is amazing. I'd love to have the nads to do this, but there's no way on earth I'm going to grow a pair this big AND get a nice big soft cushiony bouncy suit that will protect me from breaking myself when I get it wrong.</p>
<p>Well, Jeb did just that - got it wrong - when he jumped off Table Mountain in Cape Town last month.  First out was the amateur footage...</p>

<p>Owww!!  At the time, the most popular comment on this video was a little insensitive, but certainly funny and long the same lines of my own thinking:</p>
<blockquote><p>If I plowed into a boulder going 120 mph..... I'd probably be seriously injured and screaming for help. Jeb figures he stubbed his toe. He was spared serious injury by the TTS (Titanium Testicle Supports) he wears to carry his massive balls. Walk it off buddy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now Jeb has released his own video showing his little "bounce" from his own point of view...</p>

<p>Owwww!! Owwww!! Owwww!!  I think he's damned lucky and he thinks so too. He released the video with the following comment on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Jeb-Corliss/171260932916868?sk=wall" target="_blank">Facebook</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>I was asked in a base jumping forum what happened. This was my response. </p>
<p>Well the answer is very simple. I was flying to close and messed up :) I was going for a black balloon that was basically laying on the rocks and was going to try and kick it with my foot. In order to do this I had to fly low and flat between boulders. My left foot clipped a boulder that dragged me into a flat ledge that I took at the waist at full speed. If I had not clipped that boulder I might have made it, I might have still impacted. It's very hard to tell from the footage. Everything happens very fast. But when you go for a flight where inches are the difference between making it and not making it well impact is very possible. I knew this and took the risk and paid the price for pushing way to hard. I take full responsibility for my actions and am just happy I still have legs to do rehab on.</p>
<p>This is not my first time getting hurt and it will not be my last. I push it, always have and always will. One day I will die and I just hope that when I do, it will be doing something I truly love...</p>
<p>Jeb</p>
<p>P.S. I want to thank everyone for their support. 99% of you have been very very nice to me :) For the other 1% I agree with you 100%, I am a total dumb ass :) I am human and humans make mistakes. I am sorry for what ever inconvenience I have caused anyone...</p></blockquote>
<p>He'll certainly be thinking twice about getting that close to a ledge the next time he decides to go flying through a canyon with a nylon Tescos bag strapped under each arm.</p>
