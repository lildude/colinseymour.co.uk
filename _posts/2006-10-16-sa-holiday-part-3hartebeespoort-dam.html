<p>I've finally pulled finger and worked my way through my large collection of photos taken from our second week on holiday in South Africa.</p>
<p>We spent the week with mum and Sami, utilising mum's time share (again), staying at a resort called Mount Amanzi.  This is situated in the beautiful and quite valley downstream from the Harties Dam wall.</p>
<p>It was a lovely week of R&amp;R and included a spectacular visit to the <a href="http://www.dewildt.org.za/">De Wildt Cheetah Centre</a> just down the road.  If you're ever in the Northern Province round Harties direction, I highly recommend visiting De Wildt Cheetah Centre, and you must cough up for the photo with a cheetah.</p>
<p>You can check out all the pics in my <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/gallery/">gallery</a>. Oh and if you're into ornithology, there are some really awesome bird pictures too, like this beaut I took of a Brown Hooded Kingfisher...</p>
