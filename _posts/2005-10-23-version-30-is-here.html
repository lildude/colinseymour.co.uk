<p>Welcome to Col's Weblog Version 3.0.  As you can see, we've got a whole new colour scheme, a slightly wider layout and way more functionality. If you're curious, it's all based off the <a href="https://binarybonsai.com/wordpress/k2/">K2</a> theme for Wordpress with my gallery using code from the <a href="https://www.randombyte.net/blog/projects/falbum/">Falbum</a> plugin - I've modified both of these quite extensively to suit my needs.</p>
<p>I can say that this is my best effort thus far, and I've still got a few more features up my sleeve.  They're suttle, but you should notice them appear as time goes on.</p>
<p>If you notice any probs, leave a comment with the details and I'll try fix it.</p>
<p>And just for old time sake, I've kept a screenshot of the old look...</p>
