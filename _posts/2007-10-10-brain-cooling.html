<p><img class="alignright" src="/assets/samisheatsink.jpg" alt="Sami with a heatsink" />These Japanese think of everything.  Apparently, they've discovered that during severe epileptic fits, the brain can get itself very worked up.  So much so that it actually gets hotter and make the fit even worse.  So how do you think they solved the problem?</p>
<p>Just like you would with a computer - <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/blog/invention/2007/10/brain-radiator.html">slap a heatsink on it</a>.  Now I don't know about you, but I don't think this will catch on too quick.  You can't use Control-Alt-Delete to reset a human when things go a bit wobbly, and anyway, Sami doesn't look very attractive with that great big thing stuck to her head (artist's impression, and I'm not a very good artist ;-) ).</p>
