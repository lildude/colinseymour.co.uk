I'm in a pub that is serving a very very tasty beer and I've just WhatsApp'd my wife to ask if I've got time for another "[Elvis Juice](https://www.brewdog.com/beer/amplified/elvis-juice)" before she gets home from her night out with the girls. Sounds so wrong out of context.

[Brewdog](https://brewdog.com) come up with some of the best names for beers and [this](https://www.brewdog.com/beer/amplified/elvis-juice) is no exception.
