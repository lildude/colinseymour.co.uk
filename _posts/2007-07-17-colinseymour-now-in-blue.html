<p>As you may well have noticed, I've changed the default colour scheme of this site to a more tranquil blue.</p>
<p>There was just something about the red that just wasn't sitting right with me - it seemed like a good colour scheme at the time. Have not fear if you preferred the red.  See that little red box in the upper right hand corner?  Well, if you click it, you can go back to using the old red colour scheme and your browser will remember for the next year.</p>
<p>So, what do you think of my tranquil blue layout?</p>
