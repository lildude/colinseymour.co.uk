<p>Well, I guess my letter has had some effect as it's been remarkably quieter and tidier over the past few days, however the girl from the ground floor's antics seem to indicate she really doesn't care and confirms my suspicions as her being the trouble maker.  Tonight's antics...</p>

<p>This is after she thought it would be a good idea to stand on the railings between the two flats and also hold the little boy near the top of the balcony rails.  I wasn't quick enough to grab my camera for those little stunts.</p>
<p>I was a kid once, and I did plenty of stupid things in my time, but the bollocking, and sometimes a jolly good beating, I got when my folks found out was enough to teach me not to do that again, and certainly not right in front of the whole world if I was stupid enough to do it again.</p>
<p>Sadly, I don't think the parents are that fussed and it's sad to think it'll take a serious accident before the kids and the parents learn.  Oh well, I'll be the first to say "I told you so" when that day comes.</p>
