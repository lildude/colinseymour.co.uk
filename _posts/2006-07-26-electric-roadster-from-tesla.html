Imagine getting the following performance figures from a car:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 - 60mph in 4 seconds</li>
<li>Top speed of over 130mph</li>
<li>Fuel consumption of 135mpg</li>
</ul>
<p>For the acceleration on this car, the top speed seems a but poor, but the rest seem impressive. But... and this is a big but, consider these figures again, but this time keep in mind that this car is 100% electric powered.  Now that's impressive. This is the new roadster recently announced by <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/">Tesla Motors</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike other electric cars, this baby can run for about 250 miles on a single charge which only takes 3.5 hours. It's also rear-wheel drive, and when in first gear, the engine braking actually charges the batteries.  So stop-start rush hour traffic isn't going to chew through your electricity reserves.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this hasn't been released yet (due end of this year) and any mention of prices I can find appear to be purely speculative.  I'm hoping this is affordable and available in the UK.  I may then just have to take one for a test drive, especially as it will be excempt from road tax.</p>
