<p>No one ever suggests how you should recycle the box those snazzy new shoes come in, that is unless you're Terra Plana.  This is the message on the side of the box the <a href="http://barefootrunner.co.uk/review-vivobarefoot-aqua-by-terra-plana">VivoBarefoot Aqua</a> shoes I recently received came in...</p>

Here are five ideas: 1. Store your undies in it.  2. Use it as a durable yet elegant gift box. 3. Bury your dead pet hamster in it. 4. Create a window box and grow mustard, cress and alfalfa sprouts. 5. Get snap happy and make a pinhole camera with it. To get more boxes to be re-used, order another pair of Terra Plana shoes at www.terraplana.com" /></p>
