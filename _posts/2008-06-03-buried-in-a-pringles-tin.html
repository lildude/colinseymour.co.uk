<p>I think this is pretty cool: the designer of the Pringles tin - Fredric J. Baur - <a href="http://news.cincinnati.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080531/NEWS0104/805310357">recently died</a> and asked to be buried in the very thing he designed, the Pringles tin. </p>
<p>I think that's quite fitting. I wonder if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dyson">Sir James Dyson</a> will have a similar request (I know, I have a very warped mind).</p>
