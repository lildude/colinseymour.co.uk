<p>Somethings in life are just the biggest load of crap. Take for instance the Body Mass Index (BMI). This is meant to take your height and age and determine what your ideal weight it. This is all well and good for the sedentary bod who's only execise is lifting a TV remote control or a pie to their cake hole, but for big guys like me who lift several tons of iron on a regular basis or run long distances, this goes all very wrong.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://www.thebeehive.org/health/healthcalc.asp?calc=bmi">http://www.thebeehive.org/health/healthcalc.asp?calc=bmi</a> and calculate your BMI. According to this I'm overweight. OK, I admit I have a little bit of body fat, but not enough to be classified as Overweight.</p>
<p>Oh yes, sorry metric peeps, it uses that crap "imperial" numbering system for your weight. You can convert your weight in kilos to pounds using Google. (See this <a href="http://lildude.homeunix.com/archives/2003/09/12/did-you-know-that-google-has-a-cool-built-in-calculator/" title="Did you Know That Google has a Cool Built-in Calculator?">post</a>).</p>
