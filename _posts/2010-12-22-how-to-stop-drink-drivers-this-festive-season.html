<p>Yup, a little fear of intimately meeting Bubba or Gatiep or Koos in a dark corner of a prison cell will certainly do it. Of course as with anything serious that involves a bit of humour or the use of a serious problem to highlight another draws it's own <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/8216970/South-African-adverts-threaten-men-with-prison-rape-if-caught-drink-driving.html" target="_blank">attention and complaints</a>. You can't win them all, but if this advert has just the slightest impact on drink driving, that can only be a good thing, after all I'm sure more people are affected by drink driving in some way than by prison rape.</p>
