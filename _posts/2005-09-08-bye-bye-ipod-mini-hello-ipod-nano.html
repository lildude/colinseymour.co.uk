<p>Bye-bye iPod Mini - Hello iPod Nano, and iTunes 5.0.  Yesterday Apple announced the demise of the ever popular iPod Mini (left) and introduced the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">iPod Nano</a> (right) in a choice of 2Gb or 4Gb and in black or white.</p>

<p>This little guy is very cute - he's teeny weeny (even smaller than the iPod Mini), holds about the same number of songs, but now has no moving parts (uses flash instead of a hard disk) and a colour display too. It looks really cool, but I won't be getting one any time soon.  My iPod is doing just fine... it doesn't have a colour display, but it holds way more songs than one of these guys and works perfectly.  I wouldn't say no if one appeared in the post one day though :-)</p>
