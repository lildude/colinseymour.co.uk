<p>Nearly everyone who's owned a dog, or knows someone who owns a dog, has heard of and even seen the apparently cruel use of a flowerpot/lampshade looking device to stop the dog from licking it's wounds after a fight or surgery (snowballs :-)).  This is often called an "Elizabethan collar". Now, this isn't really a cruel act and is actually for the dogs benefit as licking the wounds will slow down the healing and may even cause infection.</p>

However, please try and explain to me why on earth Jean Paul Gaultier thinks humans need to <a href="http://www.style.com/fashionshows/collections/F2006RTW/complete/slideshow/JPGAULTI?loop=0&event=show1425&designer=design_house50&trend=&slideshowId=slideshow33183&iphoto=25&play=false&cnt=30">start wearing these</a>?  I haven't had a major injury in a while, and as far as I can remember, the urge to lick my injuries didn't cross my mind once, and some how, I don't think I'll develop this urge anytime soon.</p>
