<p>Well, it seems I was wrong about disabling WP-Hashcash - it seems this isn't what has caused my rapid increase of spam.  So I've installed the <a href="http://www.ioerror.us/software/bad-behavior/">Bad Behaviour</a> plugin to see if that makes any difference.  I'll watch the logs for a few days.</p>
