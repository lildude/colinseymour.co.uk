<p>It's a very important day today...</p>

<p>I don't care who this Barack Obama guy is, I will NOT let him rain on my parade.  It's my day today;  MY 30th birthday;  the end of my youth and the start of my quarter-life crisis - yes, I plan to live to at least 120 years old. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_William">William</a> better hurry up and get married so his son/daughter can send me my email or whatever fancy form of communication they'll have by that time.</p>
<p>Anyway, when you're all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_Day">tuning into watch Barack Obama</a> say "I do solemnly swear to a better job than Dubya", spare a thought for me getting old.</p>
