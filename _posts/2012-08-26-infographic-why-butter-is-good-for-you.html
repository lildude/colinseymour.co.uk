<p>I think it's about time I start writing about the high fat, high protein, low carb diet that I'm finding so good, enjoyable and beneficial.  A good place to start I think is this infographic which sums up quite nicely why I now consume a lot more grass-fed butter in my diet...</p>

<p>So not only is it incredibly tasty, it's good for you too.  Just make sure you cut down on the carbs. They're not good for you.</p>
