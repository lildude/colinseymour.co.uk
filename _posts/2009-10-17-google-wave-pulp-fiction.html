<p>I've just received my invite to <a href="https://wave.google.com/">Google Wave</a> (thanks Ali), accepted it, opened up Google Wave and was presented with this...</p>

<p>Yes, an empty Google Wave account - what more were you expecting?.  Now what do I do with it?  Well, I've not figured that part out just yet, and it seems I'm not the only one, however someone with far too much time on their hands, and a love of Pulp Fiction, found a great use for Google Wave...</p>
<p><strong>WARNING: Remember, Pulp Fiction is well known for it's potty mouth, and this clip is no exception.  Think twice before listening to this at work or with the kids around whilst the volume is cranked up.</strong></p>

<p>I really don't have this much time, so it'll be interesting to see how I end up using Google Wave</p>
