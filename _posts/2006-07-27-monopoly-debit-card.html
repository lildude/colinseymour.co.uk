<p><img class="alignleft" src="/img/monopoly.jpg" alt="Monopoly Debit Card Machine" title="New Monopoly Debit Card Machine." />Not satisfied with the spiralling debt of UK citizens, Parkers, the UK maker of Monopoly has <a href="https://www.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,70131-1228653,00.html">dispensed with using paper money in the game in favour of a new modern debit card system</a>. Now players can use their debit card to buy Mayfair, collect rent and pay fines.  Whilst certainly keeping with the times, I can't help but feel this will have a negative influence on children.</p>
<p>It hurts me more to part with hard cash than it does to flash my bank card (which still hurts, but no where near as much).</p>
<p>I think they should have introduced a credit card instead with the added game play of the a bailiff banging on your door threatening to take your telly and fridge if you don't cough up.</p>
