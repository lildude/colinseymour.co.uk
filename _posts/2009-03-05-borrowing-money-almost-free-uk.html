<p>The cost of borrowing money in the UK has hit an all time low and is nearly free.  The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7925620.stm">BoE dropped interest rates to a record low of 0.5%</a> today.  Sadly this isn't quite as good as it sounds. The drop doesn't really help many people as most of the banks aren't passing this on in reductions in mortgages and lending rates, but they are in savings rates.</p>
