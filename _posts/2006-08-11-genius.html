<p>Thanks to yesterday's foiling of a terrorist plot to use liquid explosives in a bid to blow several planes out of the sky, everyone flying from the UK can have no hand luggage.</p>
<p>In the US, things are completely different...</p>

<p>You can have hand luggage, but no liquids or gels. You have to dump your liquids before the security check point as this picture from Dulles International in Washington shows:</p>

<p>Good idea, but don't you think putting a bin in the middle of the crowd kind of defeats the point?  Yes, you stop an aeroplane being blown to pieces in mid-air, but what about the 5000 people hanging about in the airport? Genius, absolutely genius!!!</p>
<p>If the security people at Dulles (yes, the airport is just as dull as the name implies) are geniuses , the security people at Asheville Regional Airport are the next Einsteins... they've got the same idea, but instead of just piling the bottles etc in a bin, they expect you to <a href="http://www.citizen-times.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060810/NEWS01/60810001">empty the contents into a "recepticle"</a>. </p>

<p>Ermmm, isn't that doing the job of the terrorist for them? What a brilliant idea!!! Dumbass!!!</p>
