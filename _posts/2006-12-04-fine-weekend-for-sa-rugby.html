<p>It was quite a good weekend for SA rugby.  The Boks XV thumped the World XV, 32-7 and the Boks Sevens team got the 2006/7 World Sevens season off the a cracking start by winning the Dubai title, 31-12 against New Zealand in the final, after starting the 2nd half 0-12 down.  Oh, and Jake White got to keep his job (but that was Wednesday's news). Lets hope he can prove himself.</p>
