<p>The National Lottery's "News about your ticket" emails are an emotional rollercoaster. You get the excitement of receiving the email and your mind starts wondering about what you could do with all those millions only for you the be thoroughly disappointed when you login to your account and discover you won a mere £7.90...</p>

<p>Yes folks, I won a whopping £7.90 on last night's Euromillions and had the added anxiety of receiving the email whilst I was still at work so couldn't check (as they think my office isn't in the UK).  Guess I'll re-invest it into tonight's Lotto draw. There's nothing like spending your winnings on more gambling :-)</p>
