<p>Claire saw this advert the other evening and mentioned it to me.  I hadn't seen it.  She mentioned it to the people at work, and they hadn't seen it either.  Claire was certain she'd seen it on TV and hadn't just dreamed it, especially when she could recall so much detail. </p>
<p>Well, hubby and Google to the rescue and I soon found the advert...</p>

<p>I was quite impressed with this.  It's very cleverly done and builds in loads of Olympic events into the story.  See how many you can spot.</p>
<p>After I found the advert, I realised it had been posted to YouTube by the Beeb themselves and there's actually a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/monkeyolympics">whole section of the BBC Sports</a> website dedicated to Monkey and his friends and provides <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/monkey/7514376.stm">details on the advert</a>, created by Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett of Gorillaz fame, and downloads for your desktop and mobile phone.</p>
