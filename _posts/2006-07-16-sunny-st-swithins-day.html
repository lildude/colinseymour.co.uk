<p>Woohooo!!! It was very nice and sunny yesterday here in the UK.  Whilst no where near the 35C - 40C I had to live through in Madrid last week, it was very toasty and if this old saying is true, it'll be here for a 40 more days.  Which is perfect.  That takes us to 24 August, by which time Claire and I will already be enjoying our holiday in sunny South Africa.</p>
