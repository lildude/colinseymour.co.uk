<p>It's quite interesting to note that within hours of England being booted out the world cup, people's patriotism went out the window too.  There was a noticeable decrease in the number of car flags the very next day.  Unfortunately, this is kind of understandable as any sort of patriotism in this country that is not sports related is assumed to be linked with the BNP. Maybe the UK should consider a "Proudly British" recognition program like the "<a href="https://www.proudlysa.co.za">Proudly South African</a>" program introduced by the DTI in SA.</p>
