<p>Sadly, this is the last leg of our trip.  We're heading up Highway 1 back to San Francisco :-( .  There's not likely to be any more posts until we get back, but then we'll have loads of news to write about.</p>
<p>This last leg is a lovely route.  I've been along this route before and it's very pretty and goes through lots of well known places.  I think it's probably the 2nd most famous highway in the US after Route 66.</p>
<p>We'll be hugging the coast line as close as we can all the way back...</p>
