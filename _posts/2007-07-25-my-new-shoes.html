<p>Like Paulo Natini, I've got myself a pair of new shoes.  They're not just any shoes, they're my new running shoes - the Adidas Supernova Control 10s.</p>

<p>Don't worry, I won't be singing about my new shoes.  I'll just tell you about today's first run and my shopping experience</p>
<p><!--more-->I've been running in a pair of Mizuno Nirvanas for a while and I can't say I was too pleased with them.  They didn't have much in the way of the high arch support that I like and they just weren't quite the comfort and fit I'm used to. Having almost always run in Adidas, these Mizunos were my first brand switch since I got a pair of Adidas Response as my 2nd pair of proper running shoes, many many years ago. It'll also be my last for a long time. I'm back to Adidas and plan on staying for a while.</p>
<p>Today I took my new shoes for a spin on the treadmill at the gym at work, and what a run it was.  It was fantastic!!! 20 minutes of pure comfort.  My feet just seemed to fly through the kilometres. I haven't felt this comfortable in a pair of running shoes in ages.  Whilst I'm nowhere near the running fitness I used to be, or want to be, the run this morning just felt so much easier. I think this is mainly due to the fact that my feet and lower legs didn't feel tired and tender during the run, like they did in the Mizunos.</p>
<p>You're probably thinking, "So why did you buy the Mizunos then you silly boy?"  Well, because when I bought them, they felt comfortable in the shop, in the tiny space I could "test" them.  It was too late to return them when I discovered they weren't perfect, so I got myself a pair of insoles that gave me the arch support and cushioning I wanted. </p>
<p>This time round I actually got to take them for a proper test before I coughed up my cash. I spent a good half an hour in the shop umming and arring between the Adidas Supernova Control 10s and the Adidas Adistar Cushion 6s, continually switching between each pair.  Then the shop assistant made an offer I couldn't refuse: he suggested I take each pair for a spin on their treadmill, which I duly did.  What a wise move. Whilst both pairs felt great jogging back and forth in the shop, the Supernovas shone through when I could run at my normal running pace, even though they're the new season design which doesn't have as high an arch support.</p>
<p>If you're in line for a nice new pair of running shoes, may I suggest the Sweatshop in Reading, or any other running shoe shop that has a treadmill that will allow you to give them a proper test before parting with your cash.</p>
