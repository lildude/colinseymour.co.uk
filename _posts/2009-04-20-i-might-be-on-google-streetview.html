<p>I've just got back from picking up my car from being serviced and I think I may end up on Google Streetview soon.  On my way to the garage, I was passed by a black Vauxhall Astra with a rather large camera-like contraption on its root.  I'm pretty sure it's the Google Streetview car, so we'll have to wait and see.</p>
