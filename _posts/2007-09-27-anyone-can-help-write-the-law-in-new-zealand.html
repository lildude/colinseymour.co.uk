<p>The <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/4215797a10.html">New Zealand police have setup a wiki</a> allowing the the average Joe to help craft a new version of their Police Act. I think this is soooo cool.  This is probably the most democratic move a government could ever do - give their citizens a voice that they can actually voice themselves, and know that it'll be read and considered.</p>
<p>If you are just a little bit curious about the New Zealand Police Act, or even think you've got something to contribute, head on over and check out the wiki: <a href="http://wiki.policeact.govt.nz/">http://wiki.policeact.govt.nz/</a></p>
