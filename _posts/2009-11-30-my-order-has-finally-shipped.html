<p><strong>Update: Due to the threat of legal action, I've updated this post (and all linking posts) and removed all references to the company involved and replaced them with the name of a completely fictitious company - "FooBar Pty Inc". I've also changed the products involved so the "field of business" of the original company can't be identified either.  Any comments that reference the original company have also been removed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update: 6 Jan 2010:</strong> I've disabled comments as it's becoming quite clear a lot of people are dissatisfied by the service offered by this company.  If you have any issues, I encourage you to contact your local <a href="http://www.tradingstandards.gov.uk">Trading Standards Office</a>, <a href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/">Citizens Advice Bureau</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/watchdog/">BBC WatchDog</a> and/or the <a href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/">Office of Fair Trading</a>.  I'm sure they'll all be more than delighted to offer some assistance in resolving your issue.</p>
<p><strong>Update: 11 Oct 2013:</strong> The company that offered me my poor customer service and then threatened legal action because I was honest and didn't provide a glowing review has <a href="http://www.trustpilot.co.uk/review/the-online-homebrew-company.co.uk" target="_blank">gone bust</a> and their websites are now dead. You can now search Google for the company to see everyone else's experiences.</p>

A quick update on my <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/foo-bar-pty-incs-bad-customer-service-update-2">"FooBar Pty Inc"</a> - I can officially say we're in for a very cold night tonight with a very high chance of snow.  My order has finally been dispatched. I should hopefully be getting this tomorrow, assuming they lived up to their word and actually shipped it with the next day delivery they promised.</p>
