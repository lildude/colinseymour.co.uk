Nearly left the pub before the live music started but glad we didn't. Just discovered [The Amazing Tiger Band](https://m.facebook.com/theamazingtigerband/). This self-described "one man band with a bass guitar, loop pedal and a vision" is really good and just the kind of music I find myself listening to a lot recently. Here's also just got the whole pub shouting "Go f**k yourself" too.
