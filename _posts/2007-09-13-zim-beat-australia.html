<p>I can't believe it, <a href="https://content-uk.cricinfo.com/twenty20wc/content/current/story/310644.html">Zimbabwe beat Australia</a> in their T20 WC cricket game last night by 5 wickets. This defeat leaves Australia in a bit of a pickle if they plan on getting through to the Super 8s: they have to beat England now.</p>
