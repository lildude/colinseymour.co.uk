<p>Times are hard and money is short, especially in Africa.  So it's not uncommon to see the impoverished make compromises and come up with some ingenious solutions.  How's this for a wheelchair...</p>

<p>Genius!!!  Now that is called taking full advantage of the resources at hand.  That chair could have landed in landfill and taken 4 bazillion years to decompose.  Now it's helping someone get around.  The sad part is this was spotted in a government hospital in South Africa.</p>
<p>Thanks for the photo mum.</p>
