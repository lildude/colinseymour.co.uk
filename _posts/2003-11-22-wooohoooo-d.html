<p>Our offer for the flat has been accepted. We've just bought a lovely 2 bedroom flat in Earley for ?128 500. No moving in date just yet, but it'll probably be in mid January to early February.</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing to do to the flat other than put up curtains etc etc. It's got laminate wood flooring, gas central heating, gas cooker, double glazing, garage the works.</p>
<p>This is the most money I've ever spent in my life! :-D  Send us house warming presents please. :-)</p>
