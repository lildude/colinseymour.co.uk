<p>Well folks, it's been a bit quiet around here over the past few weeks because things were a bit hectic at work and then Claire and I were away enjoying a well deserved camping holiday in France - more on that coming soon.</p>
<p>This is just a quick update to say we had our 2nd midwife appointment this morning and all is well.  Junior's little heart is beating away nice and loud and fast as expected.  Next appointment is another photo opportunity in 3 weeks' time.  We can't wait.</p>
