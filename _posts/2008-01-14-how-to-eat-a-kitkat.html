<p><img class="alignright" src="/assets/kitkat.jpg" alt="KitKat" />Next time you get the chance, take note of how you or someone else eats a KitKat. Notice something?  People always eat KitKats (except for the chunkies) by breaking off the fingers and eating them one at a time. Why?</p>
<p>On the topic of KitKats, according to the <a href="http://www.nestle.co.uk/OurBrands/AboutOurBrands/ConfectioneryAndCakes/KitKat.htm">KitKat branding website</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>Big kicking former England rugby star Rob Andrew is crazy about KitKats. He had a stock flown out to him and his team mates in South Africa to keep them going during the World Cup in 1995. </p></blockquote>
<p>Seems a waste of money to me.  We had perfectly good and tasty KitKats in South Africa in 1995.</p>
