<p>The Americans have done it again - George Bush was quoted yesterday using the word "unwater" when refering getting rid of the water in New Orleans. A <a href="https://www.katc.com/Global/story.asp?S=3791806">news site</a> has even used the word.  Ummm, I hate to be the be the bearer of bad news, but like aluminum, there is no such word. Have they never heard of the word "drain"?</p>
