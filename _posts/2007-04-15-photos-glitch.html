<p>If you happened to visit my site this morning, you may have noticed my gallery wasn't working.  Well, it is now.  It would seem FAlbum's API key expired without warning.  I'm not too fussed as I'm currently working on a leaner, meaner replacement (more on that later).</p>
<p>Anyway, when I popped over to Flickr, as part of my investigations, I was quite pleased to be greeted with the following greeting:</p>
<p><img class="center" src="/assets/flickr-sawubona.jpg" alt="Flickr Says â€œSawubonaâ€" /></p>
<p>I've been using Flickr for just over 2 years and I've never noticed the Zulu greeting.  I know the greetings change, but this is the first time I've noticed a South African language.  I'll have to keep my eyes peeled for the Afrikaans greeting.</p>
