<blockquote cite="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/48338421/ns/health-mens_health/"><p>The researchers are cautious in declaring the two men cured, but more than two years after receiving bone marrow transplants, HIV can't be detected anywhere in their bodies. These two new cases are reminiscent of the so-called "Berlin patient," the only person known to have been cured of infection from the human immunodeficiency virus.<br />

<p>Certainly an excessively intrusive and expensive process to take for every HIV infected person, but what it should do is open some eyes to some possible explanations of why it works which would ultimately lead to a vaccine and cure.</p>
