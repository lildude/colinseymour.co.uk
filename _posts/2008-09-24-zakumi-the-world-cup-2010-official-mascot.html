<p>Ladies and gentleman, may I present to you Zakumi: the official mascot for the <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/index.html">FIFA 2010 Football World Cup in South Africa</a>.</p>

<p>Zakumi is a Proudly South African (and African) leopard in the green and gold of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bafana_Bafana">Bafana Bafana</a> with green hair. The green hair was a decision he made once as "<em>he felt it would be the perfect camouflage against the green of the football pitch; a bit like his rosette spots are when hunting in the wilderness!</em>".</p>
<p>You have to <a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/organisation/mascot/index.html">read the full story on the mascot</a>.  Zakumi isn't just a mascot, he's a whole persona too.</p>
<p>As for the name...</p>
<blockquote><p>The name ‘Zakumi' is a composition of ‘ZA' standing for South Africa and ‘kumi', which translates translates into ‘10' in various languages across Africa.</p></blockquote>
<p>A lot of thought has gone into Zakumi and I quite like him.</p>
