<p>I really love the ease and simplicity introduced by the internet. Last night I got my car road tax renewal reminder from the DVLA which included a pamphlet letting me know I could renew it online.  So that's exactly what I did this morning... it took me 5 minutes whilst I munched my breakfast.  That's one less trip to the post office for me.</p>
