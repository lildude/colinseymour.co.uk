<p>CNN have <a href="http://www.cnn.com/tshirt/allshirts/">started selling T-Shirts</a> on which you can have one of their news headlines printed. It's a pretty cool idea, although <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/tshirt/index.html?headline=Colin Seymour wins Zim Presidential Elections&date=1208772622000&hash=4f2e03baf9a0cc4ed25c0dee1d0a56d3&return_uri=http://www.cnn.com/video/%23/video/world/2008/04/20/vanmarsh.uk.food.whip.cnn&session_id=&">shockingly easy to manipulate</a>...</p>

<p>Watchout Bob, as soon as I can get my hands on some Zim dollars, I'll be over to claim my country.</p>
