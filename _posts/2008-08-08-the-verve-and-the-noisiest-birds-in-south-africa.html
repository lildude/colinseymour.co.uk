<p>I quite like The Verve's latest single "Love is Noise", but something has been bothering me about it for a while.  Something in the song sounds really familiar, and for the life of me I couldn't quite put my finger on it.  That was until this morning when I heard it on my way to work.  </p>
<p><!--more-->Listen to the first 10 seconds of the track...</p>

<p>Hear the "haaa-haa haa-haa"?  Now listen to the first 30 seconds of this video (you can watch the whole thing if you want to find out more about the hadada)...</p>

<p>Is it just me, or do these two sound remarkably similar?  </p>
<p>Have The Verve taken inspiration from one of the noisiest birds in South Africa - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadada_Ibis">hadada</a>?</p>
