<p><a href="http://www.extensionsmirror.nl/index.php?showtopic=186">Chrome Cleaner</a> has got to be the best Firefox Plugin I've installed.  It speeds up Firefox's launch time by about a factor of 5 by removing duplicate entries from the installed-chrome.txt and references to non-existant jar files, and it works on Windows, *NIX and Mac.  Now my Mac Mini launches Firefox after only one icon bounce instead of 5 or 6.</p>
