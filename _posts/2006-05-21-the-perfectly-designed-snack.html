<p>I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBiW3BZbw_M">this great explanation</a> as to why the banana is the perfect snack. Warning, it's on YouTube so requires Flash. I've not embedded it on my site as I still have family and friends using dial-up, and this would just make my site run like a pig for them.</p>
