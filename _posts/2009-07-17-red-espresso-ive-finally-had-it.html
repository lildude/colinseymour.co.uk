<p>Mum kindly popped a retail bag of it into the post for me all the way from sunny South Africa.</p>
<p>I haven't got too fancy with it yet, I just brewed up a batch in our <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bialetti-Moka-Express-Espresso-Maker/dp/B0000AN3QI/&tag=costest-21">espresso percolator</a>, poured the whole lot into a mug, added a teaspoon of honey, a splash of milk and tucked in.  In a word: WOW!!</p>
<p>I've never had rooibos so strong; it almost tastes like normal black tea just with the distinct rooibos taste.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you've had rooibos from teabags before, you'll be very surprised by this stuff. It really lives up to the "espresso" part of it's name: it's dark like espresso and very very red.</p>
<p>Now to get my hands on one of those 1kg trade packs...</p>
