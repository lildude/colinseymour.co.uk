<p>Wimpy is something of a South African "institution".  Almost every major shopping centre has a Wimpy and it's almost considered an unwritten law that no road trip is complete without the obligatory Wimpy meal at one of the motorway service stops - hands up all those Saffers who stop at Harrismith for Wimpy on the way down to Durbs.</p>
<p>Well, did you know Wimpy even caters for the blind by having Braille menus at all of their restaurants?  No? Me neither.  What I missed last year when I was in SA was this great advert advertising the fact.  Very cleverly, Wimpy allowed several blind people at three of the biggest centres for the blind around South Africa "see" their Wimpy burger for the first time.  Check it out, it's quite a brilliant marketing idea...</p>

<p>And that ladies and gents, is how you advertise to the blind on TV.  The sad irony of it all is that none of the burger recipients will be able to see this video.</p>
