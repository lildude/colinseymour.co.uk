<p>The government has outlined it's <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7605455.stm">new rules for migrant workers</a> coming to the UK from outside the EU and has drawn up a list of "<a href="https://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/aboutus/workingwithus/mac/uklist">shortage occupations</a>".  What amazes me is we have a shortage of "ship and hovercraft officers". Erm, I think we may have a problem Houston - the last time I saw a hovercraft in the UK was on Top Gear several years ago :-)</p>
