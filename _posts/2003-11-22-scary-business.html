<p>Well, certain things in life are scary, but nothing beats putting in an offer for a house. Boy is this scary. Claire and I have just put in an offer for a lovely flat in Earley (just outside Reading)... all we need to do now is sit and wait and hope the owner accepts our offer.</p>
<p>Hold thumbs :-) </p>
