So you've got a little spare time on your hands, Spotify is playing through your [list of favourite songs](https://open.spotify.com/user/colinseymour/playlist/4ysUSPu0kq9WxhB9php6fG), and you're wondering to yourself _"I'm a data scientist, what would be cool to analyse?"_.  At that very moment, Smells like Teen Spirit by Nirvana starts playing, you crank the volume up to 11 and that's when the penny drops... _"What about looking into the timeless classics from the 90s and see their popularity by play count today [2014]?"_

That's precisely what Matt Daniels did and documented in [The Most
Timeless Songs of All-time](https://poly-graph.co/timeless/).  This is a really interesting and fascinating analysis which is well worth the read.

The top ten tracks from the 90s, as played up to 2014, are:

For those not too interested in reading the whole article and playing with the fancy graphs etc, the top ten in reverse order by play count are:

0. Whitney Houston — I Will Always Love You  
0. Radiohead — Creep  
0. Metallica — Enter Sandman  
0. Dr. Dre — Still Dre  
0. Nirvana — Come as You Are  
0. Blackstreet — No Diggity  
0. Red Hot Chili Peppers — Under the Bridge  
0. Oasis — Wonderwall  
0. Goo Goo Dolls — Iris  
0. Nirvana — Smells like Teen Spirit

I can proudly say that I've contributed a lot to either of those ten tracks - Whitney and Blackstreet aren't my cup of tea - as they feature, and have done so for a very very long time, on my ["Listen Again" playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/colinseymour/playlist/4ysUSPu0kq9WxhB9php6fG) which regularly gets played.
