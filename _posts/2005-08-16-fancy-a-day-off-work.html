<p>Need a couple of days off work?  Well, how's this for a "doctor's" note? <a href="https://photos23.flickr.com/34473480_17489d3796_o.jpg" alt="Traditional Sicknote"><img class="alignleft" src="https://photos23.flickr.com/34473480_17489d3796_t.jpg" alt="Traditional Sicknote" /></a></p>
<p>If that's not good enough, head on over <a href="https://www.timeoff.co.za">here</a>, break a body part and print off the doctor's note and X-Ray as evidence. Don't worry, no pain is involved in the bone breaking - unless you've got some sick will to beat the crap out of someone using one finger and thus end up with an RSI in your index finger. </p>
<p>(Unfortunately, both probably wouldn't go down very well in the UK unless you've just got back from a trip to SA)</p>
