<p>How's this for ironic... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bazalgette">Joseph Bazalgette</a> is the man responsible for introducing an extensive underground <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_sewerage_system">sewerage system in London</a>.  His great-great-grandson is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bazalgette">Peter Bazalgette</a>, the Chairman of <a href="https://www.endemoluk.com/">Endemol UK</a>.  The irony? One man is responsible for channeling shit out of London and the other is responsible for channeling shit back in (in the form of crap TV like Big Brother).</p>
