<p>Claire and I have just spent just over an hour getting home from <a href="http://www.diy.com">B&Q</a> this evening.  We didn't think to check if <a href="http://www.readingfc.co.uk/page/Home/">Reading</a> were playing at home, and retrospectively, we really should have given that the B&Q backs onto the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madejski_Stadium">Madejski Stadium</a>.</p>
<p>All was not lost though: we got to spend a good 30 mins of the time behind a "famous" footballer.  I say "famous" as I didn't have a damn clue who he was.  But now we're home, I've done my homework and I can confirm we've just spent over 30 minutes sitting behind Bristol City's <a href="http://www.bcfc.co.uk/page/ProfilesDetail/0,,10327~33461,00.html">Nicky Maynard</a> in his black 6 series BMW convertible.</p>
<p>We only guessed he must have been a footballer as he fits the stereo type perfectly, and he was also hounded by a few people asking for pictures and autographs.</p>
