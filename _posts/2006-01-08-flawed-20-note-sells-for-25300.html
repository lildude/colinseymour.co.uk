<p>Collectors literally went bananas over a flawed <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/object/article?f=/news/archive/2006/01/05/national/a135924S96.DTL&o=0&type=bondage">$20 note</a> that went up for auction and <a href="http://www.wtlv.com/news/strange/news-article.aspx?storyid=49679">sold for $25300</a>.
