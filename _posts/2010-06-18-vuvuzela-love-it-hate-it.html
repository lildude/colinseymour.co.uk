<p>It's quite amazing how a simple plastic horn has gone from being relatively unknown outside of South Africa to probably the most talked about and loved/hated, in a <a href="http://www.marmite.com/love/history/love-and-hate.html">Marmite sort of way</a>, "instrument" in a matter of days.  </p>
<p>Despite a lot of complaining and calls for it to be banned from the rest of the world cup, thankfully <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8737455.stm" title="World Cup 2010: Organisers will not ban vuvuzelas" target="_blank">rejected</a>, I think deep down inside the world may start to accept that this is a unique symbol and sound of Africa's first world cup and they'll soon learn to like it, tolerate it or <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5564085/how-to-silence-vuvuzela-horns-with-an-eq-filter" title="How to Silence Vuvuzela Horns in World Cup Broadcasts" target="_blank">obliterate it from their lives</a>.  What ever your choice is, I think people are showing signs of embracing the vuvuzela and showing their appreciation by drawing on their creative talents...</p>

<p>I like the vuvuzela. I have one and I think it adds a very unique vibe to the game that is truly South African and it'll certainly help make this world cup one of the most memorable ever.  The sound of the vuvuzelas will be heard for years to come, maybe even at a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8746540.stm" title="Premier League unfazed by vuvuzelas" target="_blank">premier league game</a> near you, and this world cup's replay clips will be easily identifiable for a long long time.</p>
