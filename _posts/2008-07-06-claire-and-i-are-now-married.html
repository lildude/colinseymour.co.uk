<p>This is just a quick post to let all those that couldn't attend out wedding know all went brilliantly well.  Everything fell into place and we had a fantastic day with no problems at all.  </p>
<p>For those who did attend: thank-you very much for joining us and for your generosity. If you've got any pictures you'd like to share, please feel free to email them to Claire or me.</p>
<p>Yesterday Claire and I had a peaceful relaxing "mini-moon" in London and we're off for a "family-moon" bright and early tomorrow with Mum and Sam.</p>
<p>I'll write about all the details of the wedding, mini-moon and family-moon once we're back as it will be a computer-free week for all, and I'm a bit short of time now.</p>
