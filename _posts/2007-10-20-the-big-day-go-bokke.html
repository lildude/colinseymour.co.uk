<p>We've been waiting for this great day since 18 September, and now we've only got a couple more hours to wait for what is going to be the best game in this year's rugby world cup.</p>
<p>I'm all stocked up on beer.  I'll be popping out later to stock up on biltong, and then I'll have my bum firmly planted on the couch at 19:30 for the big crunch. </p>
<p>What a game it will be. I can't wait.</p>
