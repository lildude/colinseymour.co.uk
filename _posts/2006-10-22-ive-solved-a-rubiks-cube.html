<p>This may not be a major feat for some people, but I can now say that I've successfully completed a jumbled up Rubiks cube without resorting to peeling off the stickers...</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it wasn't all down to my own brilliant mind.  I had a <a href="https://internet.oit.edu/~cardwelc/rubiks/rubiks.htm">little help</a>.  Whilst this isn't the quickest or most efficient methods, at least it worked for me and now I can say I've done it.</p>
<p>Next challenge, try and do it myself without any help - one day :-)</p>
