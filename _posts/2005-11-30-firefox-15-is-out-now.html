<p><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> 1.5 is out now, with a load of bug fixes, improvements and support for some of the latest web technologies (CSS3, SVG and JavaScript 1.6).  These compliment the features it's already got like tabbed browsing, pop-up blocking and the ability to add new functionality via <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/?application=firefox">extensions</a>. The release also brings a nice cool new website design too.</p>
<p>If you're still using Internet Explorer, I encourage you to get Firefox and give it a try, you may never go back.</p>
