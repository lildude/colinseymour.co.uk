<p>Last night the heavens opened and a good five to ten centimetres of snow fell in our area giving us our second opportunity this year (we've had snow in February already) to wake up to a white blanket over everything. </p>
<p>Here are a few snaps I took today - I didn't go overboard this time.</p>

<p>As we've had this snow now, I very much doubt we'll have a white Christmas, but who knows. It's probably still worth putting a couple of pounds on it anyway.</p>
