<p>If you're quick you can <a href="http://www.joost.com/presents/ars-technica/">get yourself an invite</a> to try out <a href="http://www.joost.com">Joost</a> - the IPTV P2P software.  I've got my invite and I'm now about to give it a spin and see how good this really is.  Check out <a href="https://www.joost.com/whatson/">whats on</a> - looks quite impressive.  Oh, and one quick warning from Joost...</p>
<p><img class="center" src="/assets/joostwarning.jpg" alt="Joost Bandwidth Warning" /></p>
<p>So all those in SA with capped broadband - be careful.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Oh pooh, it's for Intel-based Macs and I've still got a PPC-based Mac. I guess I can't chew through my bandwidth after all. :-(</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I've disabled comments on this post as people are clearly not reading it correctly and are requesting invites. Read what I have written above.  If you don't get an invite from the site I've linked to, then I'm sorry, but I can't help.</p>
