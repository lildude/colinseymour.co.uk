<p>Check it out, the Kiwis have been knocked off the top spot for the first time in the history of the IRB world rankings:</p>

<p>Yes, I know, the rankings have only been in existence for a short time, but it's the end of a 40 month rein for the All Blacks.  </p>
<p>Now it would be nice to see the Boks hold this spot for 40 months, but given the <a href="https://www.news24.com/News24/Columnists/Guest_Column/0,,2-1630-1647_2209429,00.html">current political shenanigans</a>, I don't think this will happen.</p>
