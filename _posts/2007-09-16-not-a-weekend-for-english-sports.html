<p>This weekend really hasn't been a good one for England's sportsman.  First they were <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/blog/poms-pounded-in-paris/">thumped by South Africa</a> in the rugby on Friday night, and now they've been beaten in the Twenty-20 cricket by none other than South Africa, again.  Oh well, maybe next time boys.</p>
