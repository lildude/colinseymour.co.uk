<p>Well, Reading Borough Council have a unique way of recycling stuff - just enter "reading borough recycling opening hours" (without the quotes) into <a href="http://www.google.co.uk">Google</a> and hit "I'm Feeling Lucky" - now you can recycle all your crappy old computer equipment  and be rest assured it will be taken care of.  You can even pop in 365 days a year to lay flowers beside the final resting <a href="http://www.reading.gov.uk/communityandliving/cemetriesandcrematoria/">place</a>.</p>
