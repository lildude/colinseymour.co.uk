<p> ... I created my blog. :-) </p>
<p>Well what can I say, I've finally got around to getting my own website and putting something together. Welcome to my new website, I hope you enjoy your visit. At the moment there isn't very much here, but give me some time and I'll transfer all the stuff I have scattered around the web to this site.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely, this site will evolve to include loads of funny stuff, strange URL's and pictures and of course news about me, my family, my life, well anything really. So watch this space.</p>
