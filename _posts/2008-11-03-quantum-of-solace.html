<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001QE1BDY?ie=UTF8&tag=costest-21"><img src="/img/quantumofsolace.png" alt="Quantum Of Solace" title="Quantum Of Solace" width="256" height="90" class="alignright" /></a>We went and watched the latest James Bond movie - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001QE1BDY?ie=UTF8&tag=costest-21">Quantum of Solace</a> - on Friday night.</p>
<p>Despite what all the critics have said, I thought it was a good film.  It's the first time a sequel has ever occurred in the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=James%20Bond&tag=costest-21&index=dvd&linkCode=ur2&camp=1634&creative=6738">James Bond series</a>, but don't let that put you off. I thought it was very well done and still full of explosive action and a good story line, though I can understand some people getting a bit confused by it or losing track.  </p>
<p>Sadly for the die hard Bond fans, there weren't any fancy gadgets or the "Bond, James Bond" line and he did have to nick a suit or two rather than magically have a suitcase or wardrobe full of them (British government bureaucracy would have had something to do with this in the early days ;-) ), but if you think about it, it's quite appropriate.  The last two Bond films are meant to date back to Bond's early days as a spy - when he still has to prove himself, "earn his stripes" and become the cold-hearted agent everyone has come to love.  </p>
<p>Anyway, this is definitely one to go see if you watched the last movie - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000TQLIP6?ie=UTF8&tag=costest-21">Casino Royale</a> - and have a couple of hours to spare.  </p>
<p>One bit of advice: make sure you sit at least 10 rows back.  We sat in one of the neck breaker rows (3rd) and I feel we missed out on the whole picture at times as the action scenes happened so quick I found my eyes straining to keep up and take it all in.</p>
