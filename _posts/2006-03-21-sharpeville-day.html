<p>For those not in the know, it's Sharpeville Day, or now more commonly known as Human Rights Day, in South Africa today.  Everyone gets the day off in memory of the terrible <a href="https://www.southafrica.info/ess_info/sa_glance/history/sharpeville.htm">Sharpeville massacre</a> that occurred on 21 March 1960.</p>
