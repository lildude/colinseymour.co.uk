<p>The other day whilst filling my water glass at work, I happened to look at the contents of the vending machine just next to the water cooler. Nothing seemed out of place until I noticed something odd on the Walkers crisp packet.  That little logo in the bottom right corner.  </p>
<p>SUNSEED™!!! What the hell is a SUNSEED™ and why does it need to be trademarked?  I looked a little closer and the image looked like a bog standard sunflower seed to me.  So Walkers are now frying their crisps in sunflower oil? Well, not exactly.  I decided to checkout the <a href="http://www.walkers-eathappy.co.uk">Walkers website</a> to see if I could get more information on what a SUNSEED™ was.</p>
<p>Well, it didn't take long... according to Walkers, </p>
<blockquote><p>
SUNSEED™ oil is one of the healthiest oils there is, because it is naturally high in mono-unsaturates and naturally low in saturates. It is a special type of sunflower oil, made from a rare breed of seed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, I seeeee! Thanks to this rare seed, that is sooo rare that it needs to be trademarked (me thinks GM), I won't get fat from eating too many crisps cos of this special oil.  I don't think so!</p>
<p>Oh and for those in the rest of the world, I didn't change the colours in the image - Walkers is the ONLY crisp company I know that gets the Salt &amp; Vinegar and Cheese &amp; Onion colours mixed up. Everyone knows S&amp;V = Blue, C&amp;O = Green.</p>
