<p>Who'd have thought it... the very very terrible <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Friday_%28Rebecca_Black_song%29" target="_blank">Friday by Rebecca Black</a> has been parodied by comedy duo 'Derick Watts and the Sunday Blues' in preparation for South Africa's National Braai day, held 24 September every year...</p>

<p>The tune is still terrible, but the <a href="http://www.cardboardmusic.net/thesundayblues/lyrics.html" target="_blank">lyrics</a> are waaaaaay better.</p>
