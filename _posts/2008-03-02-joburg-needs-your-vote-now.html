<p>Voting is over for the main contenders in the "Monopoly Here & Now Edition" online "<a href="http://www.monopolyworldvote.com/en_ZA/world/leaders">vote-athon</a>" and thanks to some great publicity by fellow South African bloggers (<a href="http://coda.co.za/archive/20080201/01:06:39">here</a>, <a href="http://eishcoza.blogspot.com/2008/01/your-vote-could-get-cape-town-on.html">here</a>, <a href="http://sarocks.co.za/2008/01/24/vote-for-cape-town-on-the-world-monopoly-board/">here</a>, <a href="http://imod.co.za/2008/01/24/vote-for-cape-town-on-the-world-monopoly-board/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.2oceansvibe.com/monopoly-world-edition-cape-town.htm">here</a> and <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/blog/get-cape-town-into-monopoly-world-edition/">me</a>) and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=7840559348">Facebook users</a>, I think Cape Town is sure to be on the new board.</p>
<p>It's now time to cast your votes for my hometown, Johannesburg, in the wildcard cities list.</p>
<p>Cape Town went from well below 20 up to 3rd the last time I checked and now we need this kind of thing for Jo'burg / Jozi / eGoli / Africa's Manhattan, call it what you like, but it's currently hovering at 9th and we know we can do better.</p>
<p>You've only got a week to go, <a href="http://www.monopolyworldvote.com/en_ZA/world">so get voting</a>.  Like before, you can <a href="http://www.monopolyworldvote.com/en_ZA/world">vote</a> every day.</p>
