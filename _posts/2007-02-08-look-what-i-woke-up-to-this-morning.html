<p>This is what I woke up to this morning (between the lines):</p>

<p>Yup, white stuff, and lots of it. All over the floor, the cars, the buildings and even falling out of the sky in great big flakes.  It was wonderful.</p>
<p>I've taken a few pics and will take some more later.  I'll upload later when I'm home again.  Enjoy the snow everyone, that is unless you're in sunny SA enjoying the lovely summer weather.</p>

<strong>Update</strong>: My photos from today are now in my <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/gallery/">gallery</a> (in the Random collection).  I've also included a picture I took when we had <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/gallery/album/random/photo/snow-24-jan-07/">snow on 24 January 2007</a>. Enjoy.
