<p>Yes folks, you are looking at a pretty sturdy looking informal dwelling and separate outdoor khazi made from official road signs.  And from the looks of the signs, you'll probably be getting lost around about <a href="https://maps.google.co.za/?ie=UTF8&ll=-28.281103,28.979874&spn=0.267874,0.41851&z=12" target="_blank">here</a> in the Free State, which is probably right where you don't want to be lost.</p>
