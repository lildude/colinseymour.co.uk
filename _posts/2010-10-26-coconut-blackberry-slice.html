<p>Apparently there are two types of cooks: chefs and bakers and I'm definitely a baker (which reminds me, I still need to write about my sour-dough bread). Do you remember all those <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/natures-supermarket-open-for-business">blackberries Claire and I picked</a> back in August? Well look what I made with some of them yesterday afternoon:</p>

<p>I first made these not long after picking the blackberries, but never got around to taking photos, partly because I didn't think to, but also because they smelt so good we tucked into them not long after they came out of the oven. This time round I had the mind to take photos before we tucked in. In a word - deeeelicious.</p>
<p>One tip, the recipe calls for blackberry jam.  Believe it or not, this is a lot harder to find then you'd think.  The first time I made these, I used Tiptree blackberry jelly.  This time I used Duerr blackberry conserve and Claire and I think it's definitely much nicer with the latter - it's a lot more tart which contrasts beautifully with the sweet cake base and coconutty topping. The Tiptree jelly is very tasty, but it's actually quite sweet.</p>
<p>The best bit: biting into a super juicy fresh blackberry. :-p</p>
