<p>Check it out folks, over 500 miles to a tank of <em>petrol</em> and with absolutely no motorway driving at all - this is just over 2 weeks worth of to work and back:</p>

<p>Despite what the reading says, the fuel economy is actually about 44.15 mpg (6.39 litres per 100km) as I could only squeeze in 51.86 litres. I suspect all the free wheeling skews the onboard computer a bit.  </p>
<p>Just goes to show that if you drive very very carefully - they call it driving like a christian on TopGear - and bung in a fair amount of free-wheeling you can get some pretty impressive fuel consumption.  </p>
<p>I don't think I've ever got 500 miles out of a 55 litre tank of petrol before - diesel yes, petrol no. That said, I've always driven cars with biggish engines.  Thanks to the supercharger and turbo, the <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/blog/my-new-car-the-vw-golf-gt/">Golf GT</a>  only needs a little 1.4 litre engine which obviously helps with the fuel economy.</p>
<p>Now to see how many 500+ mile tanks I can get in a row.</p>
