<p><img class="alignleft" alt="Free Speech is Not For Sale" src="/assets/FreeSpeech.png" />You may or may not know this, but the UK is well known for it's rather one-sided libel law.  So much so, London is known at the libel capital of the world and regularly sees "libel tourists" - foreigners who travel to the UK just to take advantage of the one-sided libel law to quash any publication they feel is damaging.   </p>
<p>I wasn't aware of this until I happened to find myself on the end of an email threatening libel action (reminds me, I really need to write about that email) following several very <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/my-worst-online-shopping-experience-courtesy-of-foo-bar-pty-inc">critical posts</a> about a certain online shopping company's (capitalise the last 3 words yourself) appalling customer service.  A quick bit of research on the internet soon found me staring at information which pretty much stated: as an individual without mountains of cash and an army of lawyers, there was very little chance I was going to have any hope of defending my words and standing up for the freedom of expression given current UK libel laws (assuming I had the time or energy to).  Naturally, I winced and very reluctantly and begrudgingly made copies of my original posts and changed the published versions to cover my arse.</p>
<p>Today I was pleased to discover there's actually a campaign - <a href="http://www.libelreform.org/">The Libel Reform Campaign</a> - set up to try and campaign for our MPs to debate this unfair portion of UK law and implement the <a href="http://www.libelreform.org/our-report">suggested changes</a>. The campaign is slowly gaining momentum and has already gathered support from the likes of Ian Hislop, Jonathan Ross and Stephen Fry, however as Tesco says: "Every little helps", so I encourage you to <a href="http://www.libelreform.org/sign">sign the petition</a>, even if you're not a UK resident.  </p>
<p>If you ARE a UK resident, please also continue through the submission process and let the website email your MP. <a href="http://www.johnredwoodsdiary.com/">The Rt Hon John Redwood MP</a>, my local MP, now has an email from me asking him to back this on my behalf.  The website provides a template email which you can change to suit your needs.  I changed my email to include a little mention about my brush with libel law.</p>
<p>Who knows, if this campaign is successful, I might be able to restore my original posts :-) </p>
