<p>How's this for a small flat in London:</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/rossalynwarren/this-bed-in-a-kitchen-in-london-has-been-rented-out" target="_blank">this BuzzFeed story</a>, this flat went up for rent for Â£737 a month, but was pulled after the estate agent received threatening calls.  It's a sorry state of affairs when the property market in London means people will actually rent this place.</p>
<p>For me, the best thing is this tweet:</p>
