<p>Today is <a href="https://www.groundhog.org/">Groundhog Day</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punxsutawney_Phil">Punxsutawney Phil</a> popped out, saw his shadow and declared we'd have 6 more weeks of winter.  Well, at least those in the US will.  I think those of us in the south of England may see summer come a bit sooner as the daffs are already starting to flower and we've had two lovely sunny days whilst our northern friends battled with ran, snow and gale force winds.</p>
