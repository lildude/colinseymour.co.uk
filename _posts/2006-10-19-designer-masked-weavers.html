<p>Once upon a time, there was a little boy, lets call him Colin, who was playing in the flower beds in the garden of his parents' house in, oh I don't know, lets call the town Kensington B in South Africa, when he discovered this tiny little sapling.  Little Colin was very clever little boy and was very quick to recognise that this little sapling was for a "helicopter tree".  Colin liked helicopter trees, so he dug up the little sapling and planted it in a small little clay pot.  He watered it regularily and it grew quite well.</p>

<p>Fast forward about 15 years and you'll be pleased to know that tree has moved to a new house and out grown two pots and is now planted in mum's garden where it's growing at a rapid rate.</p>
<p>When we were in SA recently, mum kept telling me I need to chop said tree down.  "No way JosÃ©, that tree's got residents. I'm not evicting a poor defenseless masked weaver family".</p>
<p>And it's just as well I didn't as it seems 4 more families have moved in, and we've got a serious case of "Keeping up with the Joneses".  Check these pics mum too (click on them for full size)...</p>

<p>It seems this little 'hood of masked weaver nests have all decided to weave twigs that still contain leaves into the nests.  How extra-ordinary.  I can't say I've ever seen this before.</p>
