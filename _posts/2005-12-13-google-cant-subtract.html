<p>I mentioned in a previous <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/did-you-know-that-google-has-a-cool-built-in-calculator/">post</a> that Google has calculator abilities built in.  Well, it seems they're wasting a lot of money on all those highly intelligent technical minds that they employ as it seems they can't get Google to do some simple maths correctly.</p>
<p>Go to the Google site and enter the following into the search box: <code> 1 - 0.9 - 0.1 </code> and hit enter or any of the buttons and check out the answer... erm, well yes... that looks about right.
