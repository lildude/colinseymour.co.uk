<p>Dear NHS</p>
<p>I know I have now started the downward spiral toward middle age, but I think at 31 I am way too young to be worrying about remembering to have my seasonal flu vaccination.  Not only is my memory in perfect working order, but so is my immune system.</p>
<p>Please save your money, and my time by sending these SMSs to your older patients.</p>
<p>Hugs and kisses,<br />
Colin</p>
