<p>Interesting links for 20 Nov 08 - 28 Nov 08:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article5248101.ece">Employer charged after meting out rough justice</a> - Another case of justice gone mad.  I think what the employer did was pretty spot on.  Don't charge him for it though.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1088778/Regular-blackouts-hit-Britain-years-shortage-new-power-stations-study-claims.html">Regular blackouts 'to hit Britain within three years because of power station shortage'</a> - All those peeps in SA will be laughing at us soon. I think it's time to go buy that generator or personal nuclear power station.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2008/11/40-wallpapers-loaded-with-color/">40 Wallpapers Loaded With Color</a> - Some pretty awesome wallpapers here.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reghardware.co.uk/2008/11/26/vw_to_accelerate_chico_roll_out/">VW to speed up rollout of cut-price Electric Car</a> - Apparently it's going to be called the Chico.  Not in SA it won't as the Chico is a Mk1 shaped Golf. It'll be a lot like the G-Whiz, but much better looking.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.southafrica.info/news/sport/soccer-201108.htm">Bafana bring down Africa's best</a> - Wooohooo!!! Bafana Bafana are actually starting to become pretty good.  Lets hope they keep on improving and who knows, maybe the Football World Cup in 2010 will be won by South Africa (I'm not holding my breath though)</li>
</ul>
