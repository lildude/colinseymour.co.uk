<p>Woohoo, I'm back from my information overload abstinence, or holiday as it's more commonly called.  </p>
<p>Claire and I have just spent 2 very relaxing weeks camping in France: first in western Normandy (Mont St Michel),  Brittany (Kerval) and then the lower part of the Loire Valley (Saumur). Whilst the weather wasn't fantastic, we did get a couple of dry days to go out on our bikes and a chance to do a lot of touristy things, including seeing a lot of <del datetime="2007-07-08T07:41:42+00:00">castles</del> chateaux.  As you can expect, I've got a stack of photos to run through. Please be patient, this may take some time as I may need to do some adjusting to compensate for some of the poor weather (I haven't actually run though all the pics yet).</p>
<p>Whilst we were away it seems quite a bit has gone on in the world of news... Gordon Brown is now PM, smoking in public places in England has been banned (Wooohooo!!!) and there were 2 potential terror attacks, discovered only due to typical "Britishness". A clip from Friday's episode of the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/nowshow.shtml">Now Show</a> on BBC Radio 4 sums it up beautifully:</p>

<p>Other than that, everything seems to be the same.</p>
