<p>With just over 2 weeks to go until Claire and I head off for our belated honeymoon, I've started to get the photography side of things all in order.  I've just bought more memory cards - I WILL be taking a lot of photos - and one of these...</p>

<p>This is the <a href="https://www.joby.com/products/gorillapod/">Gorillapod</a> by Joby.  I've gone for the biggest, the <a href="https://www.joby.com/products/gorillapod/">SLR-Zoom</a>, to be sure it's strong enough to hold my camera and the biggest lens I've got (which isn't very big) and also to be useful when I do finally get a bigger lens (sounds quite pervy).</p>
<p>I've got a tripod already, but it's a bit big and cumbersome to trek all the way over to the US and then carry around with us.  This little guy measures about a foot long and weighs bugger all.  The heaviest part is the head from my normal tripod that I've attached to it for extra versatility.</p>
<p>A quick test the other evening proved it's going to be one very useful, flexible and capable tripod.  Hopefully I'll get some pretty awesome pictures whilst on our honeymoon too.</p>
