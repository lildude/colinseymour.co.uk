<p>On Friday morning, owners of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-Wireless-Reading-Generation/dp/B00154JDAI/?tag=costest-20">Amazon Kindle</a> e-book reader (only available in the US at the moment) woke up to discover <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect-home/costest-20">Amazon</a> had effectively walked into their living rooms, picked up their copies of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/014118776X?ie=UTF8&tag=costest-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=014118776X">1984</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0141036133?ie=UTF8&tag=costest-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0141036133">Animal Farm</a> from the coffee table and left a cheque to the value of the books in their place.</p>
<p>It would appear an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/technology/companies/18amazon.html">unauthorised entity made the books available to sell</a> via the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-Wireless-Reading-Generation/dp/B00154JDAI/?tag=costest-20">Amazon Kindle</a> e-book store when they didn't have the rights to do so.  Naturally the rights holders kicked and screamed and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect-home/costest-20">Amazon</a> had no choice but to remotely delete the books and refund the money, though I think they should probably have just stopped selling the books like any other book shop would - I don't believe you can transfer the books between <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-Wireless-Reading-Generation/dp/B00154JDAI/?tag=costest-20">Kindles</a> anyway.</p>
<p>The irony of this whole shenanigans is they couldn't have picked two better books to delete...</p>
<p>- <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/014118776X?ie=UTF8&tag=costest-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=014118776X">1984</a>,  the book which coined the phrase "big brother" in the sense that we know it today, got "big brothered"<br />
- <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0141036133?ie=UTF8&tag=costest-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0141036133">Animal Farm</a>, in which Squealer reduced all the commandments into one law, the now famous quote: "<em>All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others</em>", got "Animal Farmed" - both books are now in the public domain (ie their copyright has expired) in some countries (eg Canada, Russia, and Australia), but not in others (the US and the EU).</p>
<p>I quite like the idea of e-book readers, however I'm not keen on the idea that someone like <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect-home/costest-21">Amazon</a> can come along and unilaterally "unsell" me a book.  Amazon has promised they'll never do this again, but sadly they've set a precedent and so I wouldn't hold my breath.  If I do ever get an ebook reader, I'm certainly not going to get something quite so closely tied to a single reseller.</p>
