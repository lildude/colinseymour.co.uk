<p>If you're living in SA at the moment, and having to live through Eskom's "<a href="http://www.eskom.co.za/live/loadshed.php?Item_ID=3977">load shedding</a>", then you'll be pleased to know you can <a href="http://www.eskom.co.za/live/loadshed.php">print off a schedule</a> for your area (assuming you're an Eskom customer) and stick it up on the fridge.  I'd say just refer to the Eskom site, but I've heard it's as reliable as the power supply at the moment. And anyway, what use it is on the internet when you've got no power anyway?</p>
<p>They always say the cure for AIDS with come from Africa, but how about a cost efficient renewable energy system?  Come on folks, is summer time, you've got plenty of day light to work with devising a super-affordable-renewable-super-cheap energy system whilst there's no power to play Playstation or run your business.</p>
<p>And think of the bright side, just think how much cheaper your electricity bill will be this month ;-)</p>
