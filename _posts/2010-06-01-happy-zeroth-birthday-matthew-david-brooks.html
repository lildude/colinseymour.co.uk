<div style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Congratulations Fiona and Alan on the birth of your little boy.</div>

<p>Matthew was born at about 6:25am this morning, 2 June 2010.  No news on weight etc as apparently things happened a little quickly and early and he hadn't been weighed when Alan called, but we'll be getting all the stats and figures and I'm sure some pictures soon.</p>
<p>May he bring you years of joy and happiness, though watch out for the trouble and torment - he's made of frogs and snails and puppy dog tails after all. Matthew's got impecable timing too: he'll be home and comfy in time for the start of the world cup too. All we need now is for <del>South Africa</del>, England to win.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Matthew was born a nice plump 6lb 13oz (3.09kg) - 1 whole ounce more than <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/happy-zeroth-birthday-elizabeth-claire-brooks/">Elizabeth</a>.</p>
