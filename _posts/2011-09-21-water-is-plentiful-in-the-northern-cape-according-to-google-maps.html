<p>I was perusing Google maps the other day and I happened to notice that Google's impressive knowledge is either several million years out of date, or they're so far advanced they're already predicting future, when it comes to the <a href="http://g.co/maps/m29aj" target="_blank">street map view of South Africa on Google Maps</a>...</p>

<p>Notice the Northern Cape, the huge empty area above the Karoo National Park? Notice all that blue stuff?  Blue stuff on maps indicates water. Wow!!! Google has found an abundance of water in the Northern Cape.  Pity they're wrong.  Take a look at the satellite image...</p>

No water here." width="596" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>Yes, all that water doesn't exist and hasn't existed for a very very very long time.  To the north of the Northern Cape is the Kalahari <em>desert</em>.  Everything between the northern border of South Africa and just south of the Karoo National Park is the Karoo which is a <em>semi-desert</em>.  The chances of water existing between the two in such quantities is probably neigh on nil.</p>
<p>Now you know, don't trust Google for everything.  If you were planning on setting up a watersports business in that part of South Africa, I'm glad to have helped save you a fortune :-)</p>
