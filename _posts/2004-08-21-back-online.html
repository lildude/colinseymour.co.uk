<p>What a fool I am. I forgot to update my hosting contact details and thus didn't get the email reminding my website hosting was about to expire.</p>
<p>Well, after a little outage, I've coughed up my cash and we're back online. Now I really should do something with this site. I have all the intentions, but sometimes the motivation is a bit lacking.</p>
