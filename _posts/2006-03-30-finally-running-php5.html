<p>Well, my <a href="http://www.site5.com">hosting company</a> has finally upgraded to PHP5.  I've just flipped over to PHP5 so if you spot any problems, <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/colophon/#contact">let me know</a>.  I've been waiting for this for some time, I should now see some improved perf and I can now start using some of the new cool PHP5 features.</p>
