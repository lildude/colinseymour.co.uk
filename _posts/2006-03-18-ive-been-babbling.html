<p>We've all heard of and love sudoku, but now I've found a new game to keep me busy whilst on my shifts - <a href="http://www.playbabble.com">Babble</a>. Addictive and educational.</p>
<p><img class="center" src="/img/babble.png" alt="Babble Grid" /></p>
<p>Basically, a new puzzle is published everyday.  You've got to use the letters on the board to make up as many 4 letter or more words as possible.  Sounds easy, however the letters used have to be next to each other and can only be used once per word.  The <a href="http://www.playbabble.com/rules">rules</a> go into more detail on how to play this.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you need to register, but just as well as it makes life so much easier to check your words.  I've come to the end of my shift for today, so I'm not going to be able to finish this one, but my score thus far is 77 words, 1057 points. Not bad for a first attempt.</p>
