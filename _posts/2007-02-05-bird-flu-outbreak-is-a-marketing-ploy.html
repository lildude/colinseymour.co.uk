<p><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/6326681.stm">Another outbreak of bird flu</a> has been reported in the UK in the past few days.  This has resulted in 160,000 turkeys are being gassed to contain the outbreak at a Bernard Matthews turkey farm.  I'm sure this is just a marketing ploy - everyone knows there is <a href="https://www.foodcomm.org.uk/latest_watermeat_apr05.htm">no turkey</a> in Bernard Matthews turkey products ;-) .</p>
