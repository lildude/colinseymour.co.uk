<p><img class="alignright" src="/img/coolcashscratchcard.jpg" alt="Cool Cash Scratch Card" />You've just got to love the "bright sparks" living in this country.  Camelot (our lottery people) have <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/1022757_cool_cash_card_confusion">just pulled a scratch card from sale</a> because too many people in Britain don't have the foggiest clue about how numbers work.</p>
<p>In order to win on the "Cool Cash" scratch card, <del>gamblers</del> players had to scratch away a window to reveal a temperature lower than the figure displayed on the card. Now this is where it's gets far too tricky - the cards had a bit of a wintery theme so the initially displayed figure was often below 0.</p>
<p>Cue chaos - apparently Camelot were inundated with calls from customer's complaining that they'd won and their computer system had clearly got it wrong.  One woman was quoted:</p>
<blockquote><p>I phoned Camelot and they fobbed me off with some story that -6 is higher - not lower - than -8 but I'm not having it. </p></blockquote>
<p>Sorry sunshine, but it is.  How on earth do you manage to work out that your benefits are correct each month with those numeracy skills?</p>
