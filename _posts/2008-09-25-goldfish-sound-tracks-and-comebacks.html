<p>I'd never heard of Goldfish (from Cape Town in South Africa) until <a href="http://sarocks.co.za/2008/09/23/new-goldfish-music-video/">SA Rocks</a> mentioned it the other day, and WOW!! These guys are good. So good in fact that they've been picked up by the likes of Fatboy Slim, Mr Scruff, The Audio Bullys, Paul van Dyk, Pete Tong and Stereo MC's.</p>
<p>Now if that isn't proof you've got something good, I don't know what does.</p>
<p>This is their latest video for their track "Sound Tracks and Comebacks". The animation was all done by Mike Scott of <a href="http://www.bruandboegie.co.za/">Bru and Boegie</a> fame. </p>

<p>Now how good is that, both the video and the track?  There are 4 more tracks you can listen to on the <a href="http://www.goldfishlive.com/">Goldfish website</a> too. </p>
