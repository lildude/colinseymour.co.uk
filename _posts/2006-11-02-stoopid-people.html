<blockquote><p>"You must go back and tell Mugabe that we love what he is doing for the people of Zimbabwe. He is doing a good work. You must tell him that we love him. We love him for redistributing the wealth and land to the people," [Fikile] Mbalula [ANC Youth League president] said at the celebration rally of the league's 62nd anniversary.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm sure he wouldn't love Uncle Bob that much if it was him who's house had just been mowed over by Uncle Bob's buddies in tractors, or he had to use a wheelbarrow to carry his money because the currency has devalued so much.</p>
