<p>I was mozying around the internet as I do on occassions and found this <a href="http://stunicholls.myby.co.uk/menu/email.html">link</a> for a novel way to hide email addresses from Spam bots.  It uses a very simple CSS trick and it's one of those "Why didn't I think of that" ideas.</p>
<p>Basically, you setup the email address on your webpage by entering it right-to-left (eg tfel-ot-thgir) and then use CSS to turn it back into left-to-right text when it is displayed to a browser.</p>
<p>This is quite a cool trick which will certainly provide a false email address to spambots, however it won't take long for spambots to start acting like browsers and actually apply the CSS before they scout for email addresses on a page. </p>
<p>It also has the disadvantage in that it takes a bit longer to type an email address backwards.  I think I'll stick to the phonetic way of presenting my email address: see oh el at lildude dot co dot uk, or just not placing it on a page :-)</p>
