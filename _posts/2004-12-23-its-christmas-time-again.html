<p>It's Christmas time again... well, actually it's been Christmas time since about November, but the Christmas greetings are now starting to flow thick and fast. </p>
<p>Our good old CEO, Scott McNealy is no different, and appears to be the first CEO to offer public Christmas greetings.  He's done it in a rather strange article on <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk">The Register</a>. He has a nice little dig at some of the other big name CEO's in the IT world.  Check it <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/12/23/mcnealys_xmas_dream/">out</a>.</p>
<p>And then there's the Sun Christmas rhyme...</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<blockquote><p>
T'was the night before Christmas, when across the enterprise<br />
Our systems stopped working! - I heard whimpers and cries<br />
Windows ran backwards, our firewall was broke<br />
From our IBM mainframe puffed a chimney of smoke</p>
<p>From servers to desktops, from routers to rack<br />
Our IT guys scurried, led by SysAdmin Jack<br />
At her workstation slumped Helen, cursing under her breath<br />
As she stared in sheer horror at the Blue Screen of Death</p>
<p>All those last-minute shoppers had struck in a fervor<br />
Our systems couldn t scale, least of all SQL Server<br />
We lost BackOffice, iSeries, and HP-UX<br />
A million-dollar downtime. It s all so complex</p>
<p>Our infrastructure was fragile, we learned that too well<br />
Our OS from Microsoft, our servers from Dell<br />
We used WebSphere for apps, Veritas for our storage<br />
 Cobbled together like fruitcake, as solid as porridge</p>
<p>Our network was global, from Lubbock to Laos<br />
But nothing was working - not even my mouse<br />
My screen spewed out errors that read like Swahili<br />
When I heard Jack exclaim,  Hey - it's Scott McNealy!  </p>
<p>I twirled in my chair, and what a wonder I eyed!<br />
T'was the real McNealy - with Jonathan Schwartz at his side!<br />
In an instant did he leap and tower like a giant<br />
Up there - McNealy! - on our crippled ProLiant!  </p>
<p>We heard about your crisis, we'll lend you a hand<br />
You need high availability - capacity on demand!<br />
We've got infrastructure solutions, we'll give you the fix<br />
N1 for your data center - Solaris for x86!   </p>
<p>"Java Enterprise," chimed Schwartz, "is software made simple<br />
So your infrastructure is seamless - not even a dimple<br />
Java Desktop will put you in productivity heaven<br />
With Linux, Mozilla, and StarOffice 7."</p>
<p>Of mobility and security did these gentlemen remark<br />
Of grid computing and Sun Fires, a roadmap for SPARC<br />
Or if you DO like complexity, and taking on debt<br />
Then run boxes from Dell, and for platform, .NET.  </p>
<p>McNealy had a Java Card that he waved like a wand<br />
Saying,  Be gone! Good riddance! You curse of Redmond!<br />
Now Netra! Now Solaris! Now J2EE!<br />
On Sun Blade, on StorEdge - Network Identity!</p>
<p>With a snap of his fingers, and a twinkle in his eyes<br />
He served up solutions for our poor enterprise<br />
As they got down to business - his elves from CS<br />
I figured that McNealy might like an hors d oeuvre</p>
<p>I motioned him towards our holiday buffet<br />
Between the Dell with the duct tape, and the failed disk array<br />
He gave me a grin and a hearty Ho! Ho!<br />
And said, "Poor son of a gun - you're the CIO!"</p>
<p>We'd be back up in no time, did McNealy decree<br />
Once we were off BizTalk, and that flunky XP<br />
And then he declared, between bites of baklava<br />
Web services would be built on enterprise Java</p>
<p>And though he allowed that Windows might do in a pinch<br />
He vouched that Bill Gate's cousin was really the Grinch<br />
And CS, he said, can so outmaneuver<br />
Those IBM guys with their money-sucking Hoover</p>
<p>"Lou Gerstner!"  he scoffed, "he's got nothing on me<br />
What he puts in his pocket, we put in R&amp;D!"<br />
As for innovation and value in the infrastructure arena<br />
He said he s not seeing much from Carly Fiorina</p>
<p>The bean dip Scott liked, though he betrayed his surprise<br />
That we didn't use Java Beans, of the type Enterprise<br />
He was talking about choice, like Linux/Opteron<br />
When Jack trotted over: "Hey boss, we re back on!"  </p>
<p>As it so happened, t'was beneath the mistletoe<br />
That Schwartz promised high ROI, and low TCO<br />
As he waxed that we could integrate, and certainly scale<br />
Helen beamed at the fellow with the smart ponytail</p>
<p>So she took a quick break from her brand new Sun Ray<br />
To thank our savior Schwartz, and with a blush did she say:<br />
"I hope you won t mind a peck on the cheek<br />
You re awfully darn cute, for a programmer geek."</p>
<p>From desktop to data center, we got an unbeatable price<br />
So did St. McNealy leave us, with this final advice:<br />
"May I also recommend, to leave nothing to chance<br />
The Sun Infrastructure Solution for Disaster Tolerance."</p>
<p>Our shoppers returned, and we raised a jaunty toast<br />
To the solutions provider that delivers the most<br />
As the ordeal did teach me, there's just no disputing<br />
The performance and value of Sun network computing.</p></blockquote>
