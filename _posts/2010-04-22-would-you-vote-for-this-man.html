<p>We came home last night to find this campaign leaflet stuffed through our letter box (hence the slightly mashed left hand side)...</p>
<p><img class="center" src="http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/GeorgeDavidsonCampaign/843808380_7g998-M.jpg" alt="843808380" title="George Davidson campaign leaflet - Labour Candidate for MP of Wokingham" width="600" height="424" /></p>
<p>George Davidson is campaigning to be the MP for the Wokingham constituency.  Based purely on this leaflet (it's all we've heard of the man), would you vote for this man to be your MP?</p>
