<p>The internet is quite a strange phenomenon. A post I made just before Christmas last year - <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/blog/dominic-the-italian-christmas-donkey/">Dominic The Italian Christmas Donkey</a> - has suddenly become very very popular of late.  I'm quite impressed.  If you're curious, take a peek.  Oh and be warned, you'll have this song in your head for ages.</p>
