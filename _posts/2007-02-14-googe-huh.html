<p>As has become a bit of a tradition - <a href="https://www.google.co.uk">Google (UK)</a> has changed their logo to reflect the day's celebration:</p>
<p><img class="center" src="/img/googe.png" alt="Googe - What, no L?" /></p>
<p>I noticed this this morning and thought - "How odd, they've left off the 'l' - the BIG L on Big L day".  Well, <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/02/14/happy_vaentines_day/">The Register</a> soon picked up on this too and even managed to get an official response on it - see that little green stalky bit? If you use your imagination and squint a little, you'll see it's the 'l'.  Hmmmm.</p>
