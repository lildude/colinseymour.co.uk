<p>It's been a bad day for the Barmy Army today - Australia cruised to 602 for 9 before declaring; England slumped to 53 for 3; they weren't allowed to do a mexican wave and then to top it all off, their trumpeter was kicked out.  I'm glad I didn't pay for Sky and wake up at some insane hour after all.</p>
