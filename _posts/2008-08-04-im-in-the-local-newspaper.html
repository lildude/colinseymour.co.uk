<p>Woohooo!!! I'm a celeb.  I'm in this week's <a href="http://www.maidenhead-advertiser.co.uk">Maidenhead Advertiser</a>.  Unlike all my previous appearances in newspapers, I've not done anything special other than just being in the right place at the right time. However I have been caught red handed going for the food:</p>
<p><img src="/img/movies.jpg" alt="Me At Movies in the Park at Kidwells Park in Maidenhead" title="Me At Movies in the Park at Kidwells Park in Maidenhead" width="500" height="331" class="center" /></p>
<p>This was taken at a free "Movies in the Park" event in Maidenhead on Sunday 28 July which Claire and I went to with <a href="http://www.advertiserphotogallery.co.uk/showProduct.aspx?id=52453">Becki</a> (she got snapped too), Anu and friends of Becki's.  We got to use one of our wedding presents too: the fantastic "picnic survival kit" from David and Diana.</p>
