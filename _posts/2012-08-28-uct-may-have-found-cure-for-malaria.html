<p>UCT Professor Kelly Chibale said if the tablet is approved, it will be a major boost for scientists across the continent.</p>
<p>“This is the first ever clinical molecule that’s been discovered out of Africa, by Africans, from a modern pharmaceutical industry drug discovery programme.”</p>
<p>The potent drug has been tested on animals and has shown that a single oral dose has completely cured those infected with malaria parasites.<br />

<p>This is brilliant news, lets hope this drug can be made cheaply or is licensed cheaply.  The last thing we want is for the cure for Africa's biggest killer to be too expensive to dish out to a vast majority of the population.</p>
