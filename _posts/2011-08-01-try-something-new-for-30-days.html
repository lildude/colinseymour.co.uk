<p>Back in March, I heard about a brilliant idea.  Matt Cutts (of Google fame) gave a <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/03/08/trying-new-things-fo.html" target="_blank">TED Talk about his 30 Day challenges</a>.  Essentially, he picks something and does it, or doesn't do it for 30 days.  Things like bike to work, walk 10000 steps, don't eat sugar etc. </p>
<p>At the time, I thought "What a brilliant idea" and then proceeded to try and hunt down the TED talk video for about 4 days.  Sadly I didn't find it and ended up putting this on the backburner and completely forgot about it.  Until today.  Matt's TED talk is now available for the world to see...</p>

<p>It's not as long as I was expecting, but is succinct and gets the message across well.  Given today is 1 August, I think it's a great time to start my own 30 Day challenges and as this is my first, I'm going to start with something easy: </p>
<p><strong>Challenge 1: I'm going to run at least 3km everyday for 30 days</strong></p>
<p>Monday to Friday shouldn't be too hard. It's squeezing in the runs on the weekends that may prove to be difficult, but that's the whole point of the challenge.  I've got today off to a good start with a <a href="http://www.fetcheveryone.com/userprofile.php?id=32814&show=training" target="_blank">gentle 7.8 km run</a>.  Nothing too hectic as I'm racing on Wednesday. Who knows, maybe 50 years from now I'll be taking a leaf out of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Hill" target="_blank">Ron Hill's</a> book and could still be running every day.</p>
<p>Now I've got 30 days to think up some other challenges.  I might have to borrow a few of <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/type/30-days/" target="_blank">Matt's challenges</a> but we'll see.</p>
