<p>We had a special guest come to visit us for Claire's birthday, just short of two weeks ago... </p>

<p>As can be expected, I was a little trigger happy and ended up taking a lot of photos. Check 'em out in my <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/gallery/">gallery</a>, oh and get ready for lots of "ooooo's" and "aaaaah's" - she's very very cute.</p>
