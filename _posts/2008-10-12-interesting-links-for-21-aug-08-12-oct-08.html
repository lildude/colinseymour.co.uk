<p>Interesting links for 21 Aug 08 - 12 Oct 08:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gvetchedintime.com/gvetchedintime/index.php">Original one-of-a-kind pop art with an Etch A Sketch</a> - This guy is brilliant.  He draws these impressive images using just a simple Etch A Sketch.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1053863/Park-attendants-ordered-interrogate-adults-spotted-children.html">Park attendants ordered to interrogate adults spotted without children</a> - How bloody rediculous.  Whatever next - a change in the law stating you're guilty until proven innocent.  Thankfully Dominic Grieve (Tory MP for Beaconsfield) has a sensible head on his shoulders and is fighting against just this kind of stupidity.</li>
<li><a href="http://coda.co.za/blog/2008/09/02/why-is-beef-called-beef-and-not-cow">Q. Why is beef called beef and not cow?</a> - I was actually pondering this exact question just the other day.  Now we know.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.inhabitat.com/2008/08/25/ziggurat-dubai-carbon-neutral-pyramid-will-house-1-million/">Dubai Carbon Neutral Pyramid will House 1 Million</a> - Interesting concept, but I think it'll be hard convincing 1 million people to live in this beastie. Hey, come to think of it... lets get rid of our council estates and replace them all with one of these.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/global/main.jhtml?xml=/global/2008/08/20/noindex/pensioners-want-sign-change.xml">Pensioners want elderly sign change</a> - Is that what that sign is for. I thought it was a pick-pocket alert aimed at those with walking sticks, or the elderly when further complimented by the phrase &quot;Elderly people&quot;.  I think some people are just overly sensitive.  It's a bloody road sign.  Maybe we should start taking offence of all the other stupid signs we have.</li>
