<p>One of the things I read on a daily basis is the <a href="https://www.madamandeve.com">Madam &amp; Eve</a> cartoon. Now with all the other news site and blogs I read, I've switched to using my mail client, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>, to view the RSS feeds.  </p>
<p>I soon discovered that the Madam &amp; Eve site doesn't have a RSS feed for the daily cartoon.  Well, that's not a problem... I've hacked up a little script that will check the M&amp;E site daily and then display the last 7 days worth of cartoons in a RSS feed.  I've put the feed <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/rss/madamandeve.rss">here</a> for those who want to use it.  One word of warning... it's a bit of a hack and hasn't gone through much testing, but it should work.  </p>
<p>I'll check it daily for a week or two to be sure. If you spot any probs, let me know. </p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>It's broken... it doesn't work with all aggregators, so I've stopped it updating.  Will rewrite it sometime.</em></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>It works now.  I've whipped up my first Python script which seems to do the trick.</em></p>
<p><strong>Update: 22 May 05</strong><em>Updated script to run every day now.  Madam & Eve is now updated daily.</em></p>
