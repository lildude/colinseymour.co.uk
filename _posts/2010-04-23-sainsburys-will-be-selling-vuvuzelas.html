<p>Just when I was considering ordering a couple of big boxes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vuvuzela">vuvuzelas</a> to resell in the UK, I find out <a href="https://www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/index.asp?PageID=415&amp;section=&amp;Year=2010&amp;NewsID=1275">Sainsburys are shipping in over 50000 vuvuzelas</a> and they'll be undercutting the price I was considering (I'm not going to reveal my hand) when they go on sale in May for Â£2 a pop.  Lets hope they've got a wide choice of colours so some of us with second teams can have one for them too.</p>
