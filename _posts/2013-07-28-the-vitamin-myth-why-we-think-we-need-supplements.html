Two days later, researchers from the Cleveland Clinic found that men who took vitamin E had an increased risk of prostate cancer. &quot;It's been a tough week for vitamins,&quot; said Carrie Gann of ABC News.</p>
<p>These findings weren't new. Seven previous studies had already shown that vitamins increased the risk of cancer and heart disease and shortened lives. Still, in 2012, more than half of all Americans took some form of vitamin supplements. What few people realize, however, is that their fascination with vitamins can be traced back to one man. A man who was so spectacularly right that he won two Nobel Prizes and so spectacularly wrong that he was arguably the world's greatest quack.<br />

<p>Very interesting, if long story about vitamin supplements.  In short, don't supplement your diet with shop bought vitamins but instead eat properly.</p>
