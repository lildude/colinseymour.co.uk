<p>If you ever wondered if it were possible to score absolutely no points for a dive at the Olympics, I can say you CAN and unfortunately Stephan Feck of Germany was the one to show us how with this performance:</p>

<p>This was supposed to be a three and a half forward somersault in the pike position but as you can see things went horribly wrong and it ended up playing out like a train crash in slow motion.</p>
<p>I think I could have scored more points on this round with a perfectly executed pin drop.  Come to think of it, I wonder if I'd get points for a cannonball: a big splash has got to equal maximum points :-D</p>
<p>Quite appropriately, the Germans have a word for what you are currently doing (laughing at someone else's misfortune): schadenfreude.  Quite apt I think.</p>
