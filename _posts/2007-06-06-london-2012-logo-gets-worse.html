<p>Well, not only is the London 2012 Olympic logo disgusting, <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/what-were-they-smoking">as I mentioned before</a>, but apparently footage of it on the official site <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/06/06/olympic_footage_scare/">will also induce epileptic fits</a>. Nice.</p>
