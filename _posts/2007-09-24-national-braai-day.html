<p>I really should have played my South African card and taken the day off so I could also celebrate National Braai Day.  The day started off wet and miserable, but now the sun's come out and it looks like we're in for a lovely day. I'm on lates, so could still call in <del datetime="2007-09-24T08:52:51+00:00">South African</del> "<em>sick</em>" fire up the braai and celebrate my heritage (it's really Heritage Day), but I don't think my boss would be too pleased.</p>
