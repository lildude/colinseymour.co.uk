<p>Ever thought about living in a teeny weeny quaint little log cabin that you could take everywhere you went?  No fixed address, but all your luxuries and possessions with you without actually living in a caravan? Well, maybe you need a <a href="https://www.tumbleweedhouses.com/" target="_blank">Tumbleweed Tiny House</a>.</p>

<p>I quite like the idea of building and living in a wooden house like those you get in the US or Scandinavia and have seen a lot of "Ooooooo aaaaahhh" wooden houses on <a href="https://www.channel4.com/4homes/on-tv/grand-designs/" target="_blank">Grand Designs</a>, but I'm a bit too boisterous for such a teeny weeny house.  I need something on a much grander scale.  Nice idea though.</p>
