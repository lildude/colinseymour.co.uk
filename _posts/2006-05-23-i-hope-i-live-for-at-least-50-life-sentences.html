<p>I don't profess to be any sort of legal bod, but I certainly know what the difference is between life and death.  When someone dies at the ripe old age of 85, they're said to have had a good life, and if someone dies at 3, life hasn't begun for them.  So how can a life sentence be anything less than at least 65 years?</p>
<p>Today 4 pigs were <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/5008772.stm">found guilty of paedophilia</a> and sentenced to the following sentences:</p>
<p>Pig #1: "six life sentences, and told him he would not be eligible for parole until after at least 12 years."<br />
Pig #2: "a life term, with a minimum tariff of 10 years."<br />
Pig #3: "jailed for eight years."<br />
Pig #4: "a life term with a minimum of four years imprisonment."</p>
<p>Ermmm, how can six life sentences equate to a minimum of 12 years when another life sentence equates to just 4 years?  Surely "life" is just that - the rest of your life or at least what the national statistics office classify the average life expectency is at the time.</p>
