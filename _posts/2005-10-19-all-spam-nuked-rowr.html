<p>I've just checked the database for this site and found a whopping 717 spam comments in the DB that had been moderated.  It seems WP doesn't delete them when you moderate, it just marks them as spam and doesn't publish them.  Well, thanks to one simple <a href="https://www.chrisjdavis.org/2005/03/03/mass-delete-15/">plugin</a>, they're all gone now with the reassuring message - "All spam Nuked! Rowr!". Lovely.</p>
