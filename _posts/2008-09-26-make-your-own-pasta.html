<p>Fancy some very tasty pasta that is fresh, affordable and incredibly cheap?  Then make it yourself.  It's really not that hard or time consuming and only costs what it costs to buy 100g of strong flour and 1 egg per person.</p>
<p>Claire and I received a pasta machine for one of our wedding presents (thank-you Heather and Adrian) and on Wednesday evening we took it out of the box for the first time and made some awesome pasta. Now you don't need a pasta machine: you can still use a rolling pin like a proper Italian mama, but it'll probably take you a bit longer.</p>
<p>Anyway, on Wednesday we made lasagne sheets for the spinach and bacon lasagne and then Claire sliced up the left over sheets to form tagliatelli for a carbonara we had last night.</p>
<p>Very yummy and cheap too.</p>
