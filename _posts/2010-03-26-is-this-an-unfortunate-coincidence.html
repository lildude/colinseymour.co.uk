<p>Errmm, anyone else notice the rather unfortunate name of the journalist who wrote <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article7075618.ece">this</a> article in the Times...</p>

<p>Is this a joke or just a rather unfortunate coincidence? If a coincidence, I think it's time this journalist got himself a nom de plume.</p>
