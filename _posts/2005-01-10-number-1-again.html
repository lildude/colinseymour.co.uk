<p>Whilst driving to work this morning, I was a listening to the radio and was a little surpised to hear what this week's number 1 is on the UK Top 40 according to Radio 1. Before I get to it, let me tell you what was number 1 elsewhere in the world:</p>
<p>Lets start with our friends on the other side of the world , Australia... their<a href="https://www.top40-charts.com/chart.php?cid=4&date=2005-01-08"> #1this week</a> is  <em>The Prayer</em> by <em>Anthony Callea</em> (Don't recognise this one :-), but I believe it's an Aussie chap).  </p>
<p>Now lets come a little closer to home, my homeland - South Africa. Their #1according to <a href="https://www.5fm.co.za">5FM</a> is  <em>What You Waiting For</em> by <em>Gwen Stefani</em> (Good track - I have it on my iPod at the moment).  </p>
<p>Now how about a little closer to home, Germany.  These guys tend to have some very strange #1's and <a href="https://www.top40-charts.com/chart.php?cid=12&date=2005-01-08">this week</a> is no different... <em>Schnappi</em> by <em>Schnappi</em> (As The Black Eye Peas sung in one of their songs - Who the Hell???).</p>
<p>Ok, one more stop before we get to the UK - we have to pop over to the "Good 'ol US of A".  <a href="https://www.top40-charts.com/chart.php?cid=27&date=2005-01-08">Their #1 this week</a> is <em>Let Me Love You</em> by <em>Mario</em>.  (Hmmm, it won't be going on my iPod anytime soon.)</p>
<p>And finally, back to the UK, you'll never guess what is number one... I'll give you a clue... he's DEAD and the track has already been #1 (probably several times).  Without further ado, this <a href="https://www.top40-charts.com/chart.php?cid=25&date=2005-01-09">week's UK #1</a> is..... <strong><em>Jailhouse Rock</em> by <em>Elvis</em></strong>.</p>
<p>I can't believe it... why do we have an old song at #1?  It's not even a cover... it's the original song. And to top it off, over the next 18 weeks the music company responsible for the Elvis songs will be re-releasing a different Elvis track each week.  </p>
<p>Come on, we're already forced to listen to crap bands and artists thanks to Simon Cowell and his bloody Pop Idol/X Factor/"Whatever money making TV/music program they are releasing this week", why do we have to be forced to listen to Elvis all over again??!!</p>
