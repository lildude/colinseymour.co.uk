Since it's inception in October 2004, <a href="https://www.ubuntulinux.org">Ubuntu</a> has been my GNU/Linux distro of choice (in fact this website runs on Ubuntu) and it's certainly picked up in popularity since then.  It's a Linux distro started by the only (South) African to have gone to space - <a href="https://www.markshuttleworth.com">Mark Shuttleworth</a> and is based of the <a href="https://www.debian.org">Debian</a> distro, however it's updated more frequently, is more up-to-date and overall a much nicer distro.</p>
<p>However, with the increased popularity, comes all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FUD">FUD</a> like it's going to go prorietry, or start charging or many other different "conclusions" people jump to.  Well, Mark Shuttleworth has answered the critics by putting together a whole <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MarkShuttleworth">page</a> of FAQ's answering all the questions people have whilst attempting to squash all FUD too.  Nice one.</p>
