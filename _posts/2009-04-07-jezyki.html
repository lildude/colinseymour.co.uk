<p>I work with a Polish guy and following a recent trip back home, he brought some rather <a href="http://a.pl/Zdjecie-6237/Jezyki-Classic-najezone-bakaliami-140g-Full.jpg">tasty biscuits</a> into the office for us all to share.  At the time he just called them "hedgehog" biscuits, which I took to be a childhood name for them, or possibly something to do with their appearance - with a stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p>Well, this weekend I happened to notice them in Tesco (I think Tesco should start catering for the South African community like they do the Polish) so bought a pack for Claire and I to share.  As with the ones my colleague brought in, these were very yummy and didn't last very long.  We did however find a little gold image of a hedgehog on the pack and thought that was why they're called hedgehog biscuits.</p>
<p>How wrong we were.  Today I used <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=je%C5%BCyki">Google image search</a> to do a bit of translating (the actual translation tool wasn't being very consistent and certainly wasn't giving me the answer I wanted) and got my answer - the name of the biscuits: Jeżyki is Polish for hedgehog.  However the best thing about doing this image search was I found this cute little picture...</p>

<p>These little guys are soooooo cute.</p>
<p>So now I know a new word, I've satisfied my curiosity and found a cute picture too. And who said the internet was just full of porn?</p>
