<p>113 races later and he's finally done it. Jenson Button has finally won a race. Now lets see if he can keep things going and become the next Nigel Mansell or Damon Hill.</p>

<p>I must really make an effort to see an <a href="http://www.a1gp.com">A1 GP</a> race and watch SA kick some international arse (well we can't seem to do it in any other sport at the moment).  I think the whole idea of A1 GP is a great one and a much better indication of driver skill. BBC or ITV, pretty please can we have A1 GP on TV this year.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.motoring.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3377150&fSectionId=756&fSetId=381">Another good reason</a> to bring some A1 GP to TV.</p>
