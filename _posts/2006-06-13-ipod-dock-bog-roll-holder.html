<p>Oh poooo (pun intended), we've done it again. We were too quick to get bathroom taps so missed out on these <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/cool-blue-taps">cool blue taps</a>, and now we were too quick to get the bog roll holder and now we've missed out on this <a href="https://www.atechflash.com/products-icarta.html">ingenious contraption</a> for the khazi.</p>
<p>Now you may be thinking "Why on earth would you want one of these?".  Well, simple really, how many people do you know that have a radio in the bathroom?  Well, this allows you to listen to your iPod without taking up valuable shelf space.</p>
