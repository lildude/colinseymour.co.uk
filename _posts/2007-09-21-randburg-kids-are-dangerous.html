<p>My old neighbourhood (Randburg, near Jo'burg) has seen a fair bit of school level violence this week.  On Saturday a <a href="https://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=13&art_id=nw20070917094843363C332936">King Edward VII School (KES) school boy was stabbed to death</a> at a house party in Randburg, and then on Tuesday a girl at my old high school (Ferndale High, also in Randburg) took a bit of sweet revenge by <a href="https://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=3045&art_id=nw20070920121201709C802613">stabbing a boy in the face</a> with a broken bottle. Nice!</p>
<p>It seems there's been a <a href="https://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=3045&art_id=vn20070920050200252C373275">fair bit of school level violence around Jo'burg recently</a> and it seems to be involving more and more of the northern suburb schools too.  When I was a kid, this kind of thing was almost exclusive to the southern suburbs (The Hill High was very dodgy), or so it seemed - maybe this was just in my naÃ¯ve little world :-) .</p>
<p>Whilst the Ferndale stabbing hasn't been as newsworthy as the KES stabbing, it has certainly contributed to today's Madam & Eve cartoon (click for full size):</p>
