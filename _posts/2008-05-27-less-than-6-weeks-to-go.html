<p>Wow, time flies when you're having fun and this is no exception.  It's now less than 6 weeks until our big day.  Our gift list has now gone "live" on the <a href="https://www.johnlewisgiftlist.com/">John Lewis website</a> (and in store) and we're putting the final pieces of this huge puzzle into place. It's all getting really exciting now.</p>
<p>Just a gentle reminder - if you've received an invitation, please don't forget to RSVP, even if you're not coming.</p>
