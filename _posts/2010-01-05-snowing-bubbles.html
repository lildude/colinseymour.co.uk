<p>I've just got home after driving home from work in probably the heaviest snow fall I've ever seen.  It was very pretty and looked like it was snowing clumps of bubbles, like those that spew out of a bubble machine at a foam party.  Sadly, it was super slippy too, so uber concentration was needed.  Won't be going anywhere in the car tomorrow.  We're expecting in the region of 40cm in some areas.</p>
