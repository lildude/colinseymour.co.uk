<p>If you're ever in Wokingham during the day and fancy some lunch, I'd highly recommend <a href="http://www.greatlittlepub.co.uk/pubs/index.htm">The Lord Raglan</a> pub on Denmark street.  It's a little bit off the main drag, but not too far.  The service is friendly and polite (I haven't been called Sir in a pub in years) and the food is superb.  Claire and I have been in twice recently just for a sandwich and a drink and have been impressed both times. It's a little more expensive than your average chain pub, but you definately get your money's worth with the average sandwich coming in at about 2 inches thick, crammed full of your chosen filling on super soft bread. I can't comment on the night time atmosphere, but for a quick lunchtime bite, it's superb.</p>
