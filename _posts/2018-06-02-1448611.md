Just about to head off to sunny South Africa for the Comrades Marathon and my first holiday in a very long time in which I'm _not_ taking my laptop. I normally take it to do a bit of fun holiday coding and hacking with a beer or two in the sunshine but end up looking at work stuff. Not this time. No laptop, no temptation.
