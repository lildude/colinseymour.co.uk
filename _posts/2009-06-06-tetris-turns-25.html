<p>The name Alexey Pajitnov may not ring any bells, but his simple, colourful and maddeningly addictive game Tetris certainly will. Tetris turns <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/rock-around-the-blocks/article1171379/">25 today</a>; happy birthday Tetris.</p>
<p>It's quite amazing how such a simple game can be so addictive, so well recognized and available on soooo many different platforms from arcade machines to mobile phones.  I don't think any other games has such a very loyal fan base including these students who made a human version of the game (well, a video of it at least)...</p>

<p>It's great to see such a simple and addictive game still have an huge impression in the PlayStation age we all live in now.</p>
