<p>I don't want a <a href="https://www.google.com/phone">Google Nexus One Phone</a>. Look how big it is. That'll never fit in my pocket ;-) ...</p>

<p>Jokes aside, from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2010/01/photo-gallery-googles-nexus-one.ars">rest of the pictures</a> and the product description, it looks like any other HPC phone that provides way more functionality than I need or want in a phone.</p>
