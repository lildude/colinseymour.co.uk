<p>As of 1 August this year, BT will be free to charge it's customers whatever it likes for it's telephone services.  Ofcom is <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/media/news/2006/07/nr_20060719">lifting the price controls it imposed</a> when BT was privatised.</p>
<p>On the one hand this is a great idea and should, in theory, increase competition in the telephony market. However nearly every competitive product out there still requires a BT line, which currently costs Â£11 a month (plus calls). </p>
<p>Local loop unbundling has increased at a rapid rate, but it's only really the cable companies who offer an alternative to BT's line rental.  I really hope the lifting of this restriction will bring more players to the line rental market, and maybe even encourage someone (maybe BT) to offer a "naked broadband" package.</p>
<p>This is what I want.  We currently pay Â£33 a quarter on line rental and only make about Â£3 worth of calls. Now, I need to pay the line rental because a) I want broadband, and b) our street isn't "cabled", not that I would want NTL's crap service anyway.</p>
<p>Come on telecoms companies... I want cheap calls AND cheap line rental - actually, just give me the cheap line rental and cheap broadband and I'll use VoIP for the calls.</p>
