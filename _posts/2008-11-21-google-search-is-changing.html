<p>I've just noticed Google rolled something else out when they rolled out the Gmail themes: they've now added a "Promote", "Remove" and "Comment" button to each search result:</p>
<p><img src="/img/google-searchwiki.png" alt="Google Search Promote/Remove/Comment Buttons" title="Google Search Promote/Remove/Comment Buttons" class="center" /></p>
<p>(Of course I was going to demo by searching my own name ;-) ).</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how this affects search results and the profits online marketers make.  If users "promote" or "remove" a website, will it only affect that user's search results or will it affect the overall search ranking for that site for everyone?</p>
<p>If it has an impact on the overall rankings, we could see those "SEO Gurus" losing a lot of money as users "remove" those useless crap sites you always find in search results which are purely there to get you to click ads.  It'll also make search results a lot more useful and relevant. That said, it's easy enough to code something to automatically do the "promote" clicking, so I don't think it'll be that simple. </p>
<p>Details of exactly what effect these buttons will have are quite slim at the moment, so we'll have to wait and see, but the <a href="https://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/the_web/article5202163.ece">Times has an article</a> on the new functionality that's worth a read.</p>
<p>Will "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">SEO</a>" finally take on a new meaning - a meaning that more closely represents what the acronym actually stands for, and not what it's become known for? Or will a whole new acronym come to light? </p>
