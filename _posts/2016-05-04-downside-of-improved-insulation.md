I'm very grateful to our building management company for taking advantage of the government's scheme to insulate buildings at a discount rate, but it's this time of year that we experience the only downside: it's colder _inside_ our flat than outside, and that's even with the windows open. Damn you good insulation!!!

Of course the cut in our heating bill far outweighs this downside.
