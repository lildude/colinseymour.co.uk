<p>So you've wandered round your local supermarket's wine department and spotted an affordable bottle of bubbly in a black bottle with a funny looking name: Freixenet. If you live in the UK, you'll instantly put on a chavvy accent and say "Ooooh, Frezshneigh" (because you think it's French and it sounds posher said that way) and pop it into your basket. </p>
<p>If you've never pronounced it this way, you can move along now, but I bet you've heard it pronounced like this, if not, you're probably too young to be drinking it anyway ;-) </p>
<p>If you've got this far, sorry to disappoint folks, it's cava, from the Barcelona region of Spain, so is <a href="http://www.freixenetusa.com/about-freixenet.php" target="_blank">pronounced fresh-eh-net</a>.</p>
<p>Amaze your friends with you new found ability to speak a single word of Catalan.</p>
<p>Now you know. </p>
