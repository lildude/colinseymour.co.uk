<p>I saw this video the other day on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5199462/gordon-ramsey-demonstrates-the-perfect-scrambled-egg-breakfast">Lifehacker</a> and thought I'd give it a go.  Well, I'm pleased to say I've made scrambled eggs using Gordon Ramsey's method several times now - without the crème fraîche though - and each time they come out lovely and smooth and no where near the rubbery things I used to make.</p>

<p>Oh, and I didn't do the whole sourdough toast and roast tomatoes either: just plain and simple scrambled eggs on toast.</p>
