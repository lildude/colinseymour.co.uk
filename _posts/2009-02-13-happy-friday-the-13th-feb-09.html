<p><img src="/img/friday_the_13th.jpg" alt="Friday The 13th" title="Friday The 13th" width="203" height="137" class="alignright" />For all those superstitious types: Happy Friday the 13th.  If you're <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_the_13th">paraskavedekatriaphobic</a>, you're in for a tough year as we have 3 Friday the 13ths this year and the next one is in exactly a month's time :-D.</p>
<p>Now just to keep you entertained a couple of interesting facts about Friday the 13th:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any month that begins on a Sunday will contain a Friday the 13th.</li>
<li>There is at least one Friday the 13th in every calendar year.</li>
<li>The longest period that can occur without a Friday the 13th is fourteen months, either from July to September the following year (e.g. in 2001/2002 and 2012/13), or from August to October in a leap year (e.g. in 2027/28).</li>
<li>Apparently, even though there are normally less cars on the road on Friday the 13th (as compared with other Fridays) more accidents are reported.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today in the UK would be one of the exceptions to the last fact as half term starts today and every arse and his dog is on the road and in some cases it appears the dogs are doing the driving.</p>
<p>For those who aren't superstitious, I hope you had a fabulous day.</p>
