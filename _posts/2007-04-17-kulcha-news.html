<p>I was catching up on the SA Blogs I read and <a href="http://www.aquilaonline.co.za/2007/04/introducing-kulcha-news/">saw this post</a> from <a href="http://www.aquilaonline.co.za/">Aquila</a>.</p>
<p>SA now has a new news site - <a href="http://news.kulcha.co.za/">Kulcha News</a> - providing accounts of events and accidents pretty much as they happen, including pictures. (WARNING: Some of these are not for the faint hearted). How do they do it?  Well, I'll let Kulcha News answer that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kulcha News provides you with up to date news on accidents and events by the paramedics who attend to them. Most reports and pictures are provided with the kind courtesy of Netcare 911, ER24 and The NSRI.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I've had a squiz through some of the most recent posts, and whilst I don't think they're particularly harsh (by SA standards), you may.  Don't say I didn't warn you.</p>
<p>I think Aquila sums it up well:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's gripping, gross, enticing, shocking, informative, weird and wonderful all in one...</p></blockquote>
<p>... and with pictures too.</p>
