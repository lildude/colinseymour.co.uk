<p>This is a post just for the sake of a post.  It's to commemorate the occasion that is the 1000th post on this blog since it's inception way back on <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/in-the-beginning">18 August 2003</a>.  Now by most "bloggers" standards, this is a pitiful number, but given that I don't write about anything and everything here  - I keep my <a href="http://www.lildude.co.uk">techie</a> and <a href="http://barefootrunner.co.uk">running</a> stuff on separate blogs so as not to bore everyone - it's not too bad at all.</p>
