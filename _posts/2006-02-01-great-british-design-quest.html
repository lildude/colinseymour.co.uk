<p>The Poms are pretty ingenius buggers - so much so, the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk">Beeb</a> is show casing a shortlist of the top 25 British designs in it's "<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/cultureshow/designquest/vote/">Great British Design Quest</a>".  My fav's have got to be <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/cultureshow/designquest/icons/phase1/in/gtha.shtml">Grand Theft Auto</a> and the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/cultureshow/designquest/icons/phase1/in/twww.shtml">World Wide Web</a>.  Of course the Sefrican's aren't too bad at inventing stuff either, like the <a href="http://www.kreepykrauly.co.za/our_success.htm">Kreepy Krauly</a> and now some oke has created a <a href="http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=31&art_id=qw113852052314B216">machine that cleans tekkies in just 10 minutes</a>.</p>
