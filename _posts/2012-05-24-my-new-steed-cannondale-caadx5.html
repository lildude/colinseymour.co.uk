<p>Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you my new trusty steed...</p>
<p><a href="https://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Random/i-FCtvN6G/0/XL/My-New-Steed-XL.jpg"><img class="center" src="https://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Random/i-FCtvN6G/0/M/My-New-Steed-M.jpg" alt="1865865830" title="My new Steed: a Cannondale CAADX5" width="600" height="408" /></a></p>
<p>After a little hiccough with the first order - the first bike ordered was missing components from the brakes when it arrived at the shop - I collected my new bicycle, a Cannondale CAADX5 (it's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclo-cross" target="_blank">cyclocross</a> bike), this evening and took it for a bit of a lengthy spin home.  Lovely bike and I'm in for many happy hours of cycling ahead of me.</p>
<p>So far I've put my computer and the brackets for my lights (note to self, I still need to blog about <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005X6RIN8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=colsey-21" target="_blank">these great lights</a>) onto the new bike.  The only things still to do are put on the mudguards and move the cage from one of my other bikes.  Yes, I know this is a cyclocross bike so I shouldn't be putting a cage and mudguards on it, but it's technically a bundu-bashing road bike to me, so they're kind of essential.</p>
<p>Oh yes, if you're curious, I'm taking full advantage of the <a href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/" target="_blank">Cycle to Work scheme</a> we get at work (I went for the full Â£1000) which means in the long run I'll save about 42% on the cost of this bike.  Nice!!  If you need (or want) a new bike you should definitely take full advantage of the various Cycle to Work schemes.  You'll be able to get a nice bike and save a fortune in the long run.</p>
