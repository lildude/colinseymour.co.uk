<p><img class="alignleft" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1028/534775107_521da1011b_t.jpg" alt="Screenshot of my calendar page." />I've been meaning to do this for a very very very long time, and now I finally have.  My new and improved calendar is available for all to see.</p>
<p>I used to use a bodged together script that used to scrape the calendar server here at work. Well, now I don't. Instead I've implemented <a href="http://phpicalendar.net/">PHPiCalendar</a> and performed a serious amount of customisation in order to get it to look the way it does (the <a href="http://phpicalendar.net/phpicalendar/month.php">default look</a> is quite boring). I've also limited the default installation as I don't need or want all the functionality that PHPiCalendar provides.</p>
<p>Now my calendar shows 4 calendars in one - my work calendar (managed at work), my general calendar (managed on Google), my birthdays and anniversaries calendar (managed at home) and a general UK bank holiday calendar (courtesy of Google).  All are drawn from ical files and updated every 12 hours.</p>
<p>If you use my calendar to keep track of my whereabouts, I hope you like the new one.</p>
