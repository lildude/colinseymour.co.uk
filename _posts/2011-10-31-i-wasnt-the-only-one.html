<p>Several years ago I had a bit of a <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/my-worst-online-shopping-experience-courtesy-of-foo-bar-pty-inc">run in with a certain online retailer</a> by the name of "FooBar Pty Inc".  Obviously this isn't the company's real name, but given I had an opinion about this company and it was a negative one, they decided my words were far too bad for business so threatened legal action if I didn't remove them.  I obliged by removing their name and products from the posts and comments.</p>
<p>Well imagine my delight today when I discovered the following <a href="https://www.jimsbeerkit.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=21760" target="_blank">post</a> on one of the forums I visit regularly...</p>

<p>It's dated 21 March 2009, which is about 8 months before my run in with them.  I have no idea how I missed this post all this time as I regularly turn to the <a href="https://www.jimsbeerkit.co.uk/" target="_blank">Jim's Beer Kit forums</a> when I'm thinking about trying something new in brewing.</p>
<p>I'm glad I'm not the only one who they threatened.  To this day, I have gone to more reputable companies, even if it means spending a little bit more.  I think these legal threats, especially against a large community forum (which of course is a competitor to their own forums), have probably had more of a negative impact on their business than a few negative reviews would.  Big spenders will always consider negative reviews and take them with a pinch of salt.  It's hard to ignore threats of legal action.</p>
<p>Oh well, it's their business, not mine. They're free to run it how they like.</p>
<p>Naturally, comments are disabled on this post.</p>
