<p>Got a bit of spare cash lying around?  Britain's one and only underground city is up for sale. <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1849406,00.html">The Times</a> have all the details, but doesn't have any pics.  However, I have found a <a href="http://www.mod.uk/linked_files/dcsa/corsham_tunnels_history.htm">page</a> with a few pics and a bit more history.</p>
