<p>I really hope for the neighbour's sake that this cat has 9 lives. I regularily see this cat on the roof across the drive whilst I'm sitting at my desk, but today was the first time I've seen the cat being "reckless" up there. Today he was chasing flies, and getting quite close to the edge too.</p>
