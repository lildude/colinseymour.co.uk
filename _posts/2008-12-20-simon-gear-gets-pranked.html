<p>First some background: my cousin, Simon Gear, is a weather man for the SABC back in South Africa (he does other media related stuff like talkshows etc too).  <a href="https://www.highveld.co.za/">94.7 Highveld Stereo</a> is a radio station in Jo'burg on which a guy called Darren Simpson, aka Whackhead, regularly pranks people.</p>
<p>I've just been catching up on my Highveld podcasts and have just heard this gem: Simon Gear, my cousin, got some of the Whackhead treatment.  Take a listen and enjoy.</p>
