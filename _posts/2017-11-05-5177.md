I don't know what it is, but the peeps in San Francisco are really having a hard time understanding me this week. I've been called "Holland" four times (Claire thinks it's a cool name, but for me I'm more thankful I've not been called Colon yet on this trip) and have had to repeat myself umpteen times when ordering almost everything. I'm not sure if it's because I've become too British ðŸ˜±, am not loud enough ðŸ˜± (I'd normally say impossible for a Saffer but the Americans are generally very _loud_) or if the time back in South Africa earlier this year for Comrades has knackered my vowels again but it's definitely different this trip. On the plus side, I used it to my advantage when [fondling puppies](http://thepress.sfchronicle.com/wine/event/pawtrero-s-11th-annual-dog-day-afternoon-and-adoption-event59c19cb806d91) this morning ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£
