<p>Confused??? I was.  I received a notification telling me I had commented on one of my <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/god-of-squirrels-will-look-out-for-me">sidenote posts</a>.  Normally, this isn't a problem as I do comment on my own site, but this time I hadn't.</p>
<p>So, I checked it out, and found Colin J Seymour, one of the other top "Colin Seymour's" on Google had popped by, and left a comment, the solution to my <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/1960s-puzzle">puzzle</a> and left another puzzle. Nice one.</p>
<p>I liked the puzzle, so thought I'd open it to the world as a main post:</p>
<blockquote><p>A cyclist has been travelling to and fro from his work for a few months.<br />
He works out that he has travelled a total of 1243 miles.<br />
How many miles a day does he travel, and how far away does he live from his work?
</p></blockquote>
<p>I've worked this out, can you?</p>
