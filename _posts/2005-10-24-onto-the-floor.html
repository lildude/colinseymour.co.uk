<p>I've booked another week off work to see if I can make a big jump in the progress of the finishing the recoration of the bathroom.  I forgot to upload pics of where I finished last time, so here they are.  This is what the bathroom looked like this morning when I started:</p>

<p>Today's challenge was to lay all the tiles on the floor that don't need cutting.  The B&Q book I used for advice and tips recommends leaving 24 hours between laying the full tiles and laying the cut tiles, so that's what I'm doing. Well, I met my target for the day and laid all the complete tiles. Check it out...</p>

<p> The bathroom looks so much better already and feels bigger too.</p>
