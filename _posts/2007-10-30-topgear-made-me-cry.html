<p>As is common in a lot of households in the UK, Sunday evenings at 8pm is <a href="http://www.topgear.com/">TopGear</a> time.  For those who don't know, TopGear is the best car program I've ever seen and it's broadcast on BBC 2 every Sunday at 8pm. This week's episode has got to go into the history books as one of the funniest episodes of all time - I had tears streaming down my face I was laughing so much. </p>
<p>Jeremy Clarkson did a 10 minute piece on the smallest mass produced car ever - a 1960's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peel_P50">Peel P50</a>.  Thanks to the wonders of the internet, and YouTube, you too can now watch this funny little clip (needs sound to fully appreciate it).  It's brilliant!! Enjoy.</p>
