<p>I was playing around on Google Maps yesterday and I thought I'd see if Google Maps knew about South Africa - well it does, to an extent.  Large portions are still blank, and there is only satellite view, which in some portions is very poor quality.</p>
<p>That aside, I managed to find mum's house and took a snapshot of it.  <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/gallery/album/clips/photo/28477177">Check it out</a>. (Move your mouse over the image to view the two blocks I've highlighted).</p>
