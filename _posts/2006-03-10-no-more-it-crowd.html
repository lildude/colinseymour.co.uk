<p>I'm not a very happy person this evening... one of the funniest sitcoms on TV for a long time, the <a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/I/itcrowd/">IT Crowd</a>, isn't on any more. It was only a 6 episode series and the 6th episode was last week :-( .</p>
<p>Come on Channel 4, if you're going to release a brilliant TV series, you've got to make it at least 20 episodes long, just like <a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/L/lost/">Lost</a>.</p>
