<p>Did you know the "Happy Birthday" song and tune is copyrighted? (is that even a word?) - check out <a href="https://www.unhappybirthday.com/">Unhappy Birthday</a> for all the details.  It details American law, but similar issues arise within the UK too.  So next time you're planning on singing this - remember, you may be breaking the law.</p>
