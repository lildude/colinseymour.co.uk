<p>Swedish living is taking over in the UK.  IKEA is now offering flatpack housing... well, almost.  You can't pop into IKEA and pick up a box and take it home, but almost. IKEA is partnering with several firms to bring more cheap, affordable (wooden) housing to the UK - <a href="http://www.boklok.com/">The BoKlok Concept</a>.</p>
