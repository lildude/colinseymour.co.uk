<p>Tetleys have just released a new product - <a href="https://www.tetley.co.uk/specialteas/rooibos.html">Redbush & Vanilla</a> tea.  It's quite an interesting take on the classic South African rooibos tea and it's quite tasty too. What is interesting, is their website calls it "Rooibos & Vanilla", but their advertising and the actual tin call it "Redbush & Vanilla" - I wonder why the change.</p>
