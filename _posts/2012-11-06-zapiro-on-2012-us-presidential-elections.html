<p>Unless you're living under a rock without internet, TV or radio access (how are you reading this then ;-)) you'll know today is a big day in the United States.  One of the world's biggest economies will finish spending vast amounts of money <del>buying</del> persuading voters to vote for one of two men to lead their country for the next four years.</p>
<p>I think Zapiro's cartoon in The Times today is quite apt...</p>
<figure class="center"><img alt="Zapiro06Nov2012.jpg" src="/assets/Zapiro06Nov2012.jpg" width="608" height="412" /><br />
<figcaption><a href="http://www.zapiro.com/cartoon/1293386-121106tt" target="_blank">From Zapiro's own site</a>: "National polls in the US show the U.S. Presidential Election to be a virtual tie, leading many pundits and analysts to brand the result "too close to call." While Barack Obama has been a disappointment to many who expected him to make a real change, Zapiro's cartoon feels that the other guy Mitt Romney could be a danger to world peace."</figcaption>

<p>I hope, for the benefit of all Americans and the rest of the world, that Barack Obama gets a second term.  I'm not convinced by Mr Moneybags Mitt Romney one iota. </p>
