<p>Eminem's latest song, Mocking Bird, is based on the old childrens lullaby.  Now, had Eminem come from the <a href="http://www.cape-town.info/cape-town-attractions/cape-flats/">Cape Flats</a> (just outside Cape Town), his song would have lines similar to these (I've added definitions to the Afrikaan's words, so just hover you mouse over the word for a translation):</p>
<blockquote><p>Hush my laaitie, don't you cry<br />
Daddy's gonna steal you a GTi,<br />
And if that GTi don't Torque,<br />
Another GTi I will stalk.<br />
And if the stalking don't go too well<br />
Daddy's gonna steal you a Caravelle<br />
And if that Caravelle makes some tricks<br />
Daddy's gonna 'jack you a VR6.<br />
And if that VR6 won't fly,<br />
Daddy's gonna knock a BM from a Sandton guy.<br />
And if that BM's sound is kwaai,<br />
Da Lenz cherries will go with you to elke braai!<br />
And if the cops ask why,<br />
Daddy will buy the docket from a Police spy!<br />
And if all these things still make you cry...</p>
<p>Then you're not my laaitie<br />
..... your mom told me a lie !!</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the email mum.</p>
