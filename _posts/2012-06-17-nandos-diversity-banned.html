<p>Nando's are at it again with their very good adverts.  This time, they've got one the <a href="http://www.channel24.co.za/TV/News/Nandos-get-ready-to-fight-ad-ban-20120606" target="_blank">SABC, eTV and DStv/MNET will not broadcast</a>, however it hasn't actually been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).</p>
<p>Of course the TV companies are the ones who are looking silly at the moment as apparently the ASA have received only two complains.  What's more this advert has probably been seen more times on the internet - for free - than it would ever have on TV, something Nando's would have had to pay for.</p>
<p>If you haven't seen it yet, here you go...</p>
