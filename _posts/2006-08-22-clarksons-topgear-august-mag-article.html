<p>I quite like Jeremy Clarkson. I don't always agree with his point of view, but I enjoy reading his various columns, editorials and books. Oh, and I enjoy TopGear.  August's TopGear magazine has Jeremy having a good ol' rant about stupid people and their bodily functions.  I was flying to Madrid when I read this and received a lot of odd stares as I giggled to myself.  I couldn't help it - whilst I'm not like any of the stupid people he refers to, I can relate so easily.</p>
<p>I've scanned the article and <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/downloads/Clarkson-Aug06.pdf">converted it to PDF</a> for you to enjoy too (warning it's a big file) - see, I'm saving you Â£3.90 - what a nice guy.  </p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
