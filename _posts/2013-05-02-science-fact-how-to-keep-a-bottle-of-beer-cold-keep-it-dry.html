<p>So, want to keep that bottle cold longer – keep it dry.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Plenty of examples exist for evaporative cooling, but few for the reverse phenomenon, and Durran thought droplets that form on a cold canned beverage might be just the example he was looking for. A quick back-of-the-napkin calculation showed the heat released by water just four thousandths of an inch thick covering the can would heat its contents by 9 degrees Fahrenheit.<br />

<p>Just as well I drink mostly real ale served at ambient temperature.  That said, I think I might need to invest in a stubbie holder for those few ales best served cold.</p>
