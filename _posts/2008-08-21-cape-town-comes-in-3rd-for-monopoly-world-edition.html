We're taking your women, jobs and now board games too.</p>
<p>The big push by various South African bloggers, <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/blog/get-cape-town-into-monopoly-world-edition/">me included</a>, to get the most beautiful city in the world - Cape Town - onto the World Edition of Monopoly has paid off.  Cape Town rocketed from not even being in contention right up to 3rd and that's where it stayed until the voting was closed.</p>
<p>Well, the <a href="http://www.hasbro.com/games/kid-games/monopoly/default.cfm?page=News/Item&newsID=DB7DFA53-D56F-E112-458E61859535CD3D">official results</a> are out, and Cape Town came in 3rd (click thumbnail on right for full results).  Wooohoooo!!!</p>
