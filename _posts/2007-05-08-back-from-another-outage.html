<p>Sorry about the small outage over the past few days.  It seems my hosting company has a bug in their PHP5 compilation which was causing the process to crash everytime someone attempted to access the front page of this site.</p>
<p>I know it's not my code as this was working fine the other day and I've not changed anything.  What's more, this exact code runs fine on another server hosting my <a href="https://www.lildude.co.uk">tech blog</a>.</p>
<p>I've worked around the problem by switching back to using PHP4 for time being. I'm not going to bother logging a ticket with my current hoster as I plan on moving some time soon, and given their history of incompetence, I very much doubt they'll be able to get to the bottom of it anytime soon.</p>
