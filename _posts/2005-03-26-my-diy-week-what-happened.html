<p>As you can see, I kind of died down on the updates.  That's primarily because there wasn't much progress.  On the Friday of my week off, I completed laying out the full tiles on the wall under the window... only to discover I'd put them on wonky.  Now a couple of mm out isn't too bad, but I was out by about 1cm.  As you can imagine this look aweful, so off they came. Instead I tiled the wall above the bath. That was pretty much the end of progress on the bathroom last week. With both the long walls tiles, I can now tile the window wall and ensure that both sides match up correctly.</p>
<p>This weekend we're back on bathroom duty.  The bathroom suite got delivered yesterday, so I got cracking putting it in.  I ended up having a couple of trips to the DIY show to get a couple of things as I encountered a few problems on the way.  By the end of the day, it was all starting to look like a new bathroom.  I'd managed to put in the bath and the basin yesterday.  I've got a couple of leaks to sort out, but otherwise all went well.</p>

<p>All that needs to be put in now is the new loo, which I'll probably do this afternoon or tomorrow.</p>
