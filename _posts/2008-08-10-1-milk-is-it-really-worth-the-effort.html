<p>Life is already far too complicated with all the choices we can have when we go shopping: Branded or not? Organic or "normal"? Free range or battery? Fresh or frozen?  High fat, medium far or low fat?</p>
<p>Well, Sainsburys have complicated matters further in the milk department. We'll ignore the whole branded/unbranded and organic/normal choices and look at the Sainsburys' own milk:</p>

<p>Yes - you now have a choice of 4.  You used to only be able to select skimmed (red), semi-skimmed (green) and whole (blue), but now they've introduced a 4th (orange) and relabeled all the others too.</p>
<p>The red label now advises it's 0.1% fat "skimmed".  There's now a new orange label that advises it's 1% fat "milk", the green now advises it's 2% fat "semi-skimmed" (if I recall correctly SA call it 2%) and the blue says it's 4% fat "whole". </p>
<p>I can understand the change in labeling with the ever growing obesity levels, but do we actually need a 1% fat milk?  </p>
<p>Do people actually approach the shelves and say to themselves "<em>I really need to start watching my weight.  I've been drinking semi-skimmed for years and can't stand skimmed. Oh I so do wish there was something between the two</em>" ?</p>
<p>Another thing: can you actually taste the difference between skimmed, 1% and 2%?  Maybe it's time for another double blind test.</p>
