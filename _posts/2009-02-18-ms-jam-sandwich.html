<p><img src="/img/hugosmixfruitjam.jpg" alt="Hugo\'s Mix Fruit Jam" title="Hugo\'s Mix Fruit Jam" width="200" height="200" class="alignright" />If you are one of those people who are:</p>
<ol>
<li>too busy to remove bread from a packet,</li>
<li>physically incapable of opening a jar or</li>
<li>untrained in the use of a knife</li>
</ol>
<p>... you'll be pleased to learn that as of next Thursday <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/4684974/Marks-and-Spencer-to-sell-jam-sandwiches.html">Marks &amp; Spencer will be selling a 75p jam sandwich</a> featuring, er, bread, butter and strawberry jam.</p>
<p>Apparently this is the "<em>perfect quick fix, credit crunch lunch</em>". I say it's a perfect way to show people just how much profit M&amp;S makes from their sarmies.</p>
<p>Anyway, as any child who grew up in South Africa knows, these won't be the <em>real thing</em>.  A <em>real</em> jam sandwich is made using two doorstep-thick slices of white bread and ladles of Hugo's Mix Fruit Jam ooozing out the sides (butter and or peanut butter optional).</p>
