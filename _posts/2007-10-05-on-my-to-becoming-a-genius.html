<p>Scientist have discovered that <a href="https://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=439863EB-E7F2-99DF-3FE0A7665EBFA7A3&chanID=sa003">one or two beers a day is actually good for your memory</a>.  That's right, beer can actually make you smarter.</p>
<p>They speculate that this is due to some sort of receptor being blocked by the low dose of alcohol.  This in turn apparently results in a compensatory response from the part of the brain responsible for cognition, and thus enhanced memory.</p>
<p>My theory: it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinism">Darwinian</a> principle.  The low doses of alcohol fry the weaker brain cells, thus only allowing the stronger ones to survive. As there are less brain cells, the stronger ones have to work a bit harder until new brain cells grow. It's the simple theory of survival of the fittest. Just be careful: too much alcohol and the strong cells will be fried too ;-) .</p>
<p>Anyway, who cares which theory is correct.  All I care about is becoming a genius, so I'll be starting my 2-a-day regime today.  Watch this space - I might be a genius sooner than you think.</p>
