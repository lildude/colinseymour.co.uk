<p>Interesting links for 31 Jul 09 - 10 Sep 09:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8243553.stm">Makeover for SA gender-row runner</a> - See, told you she was a lady. Maybe she should have hit the track all tarted up to keep the IAAF happy.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.news24.com/Content/SciTech/News/1132/1bc8b09e39b043928317dc769d4196e4/09-09-2009-12-23/Pigeon_beats_Telkom">Pigeon beats Telkom</a> - He did it. Winston proved that good old fashioned homing pigeons are way quicker to send data than Telkom's 1mbps ADSL.  Pity you can't surf the internet with a pigeon.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.henriska.com/blog/?p=615">Pigeon beats ADSL handsdown .. classic.</a> - What a brilliant way to kick Telkom (South Africa's largest telecoms company) into gear and make them catch a wake up about their high costs and bad service.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.news24.com/Content/SouthAfrica/News/1059/fe7b920c66fd476fada2438e33ed8eb5/01-09-2009-03-00/Canada_shocked_to_learn_Hartley_wasnt_last_white_in_SA__">Canada shocked to learn Huntley wasn't last white in SA</a> - Haa haa haa.  I love how the South Africans in Canada are treated like the Aussies in the UK - they're all bar or restaurant workers.  Pity someone filled them in on the truth - claiming refugee status in Canada was top of my list of things to do next.</li>
<li><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090729/ap_on_he_me/us_med_malaria_vaccine;_ylt=AotygrD.KWkp1jxews.WrrOs0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTE2OHVqdHA0BHBvcwM3BHNlYwNNd19WaXRhbGl0eQRzbGsDbW9zcXVpdG9lc2Rl">Mosquitoes deliver malaria 'vaccine' through bites</a> - What a great idea. Pity it's not feasible on a large scale yet, but who knows, maybe it will be in the future.  This will save millions of lives.</li>
