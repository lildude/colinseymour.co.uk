<p>It's been crazy at work over the past few weeks, but things are bound to get better now.  We're getting an upgrade to our vending machines.  To quote the email I received yesterday...</p>
<blockquote><p>The new offer will consist of hot beverage drinks to include:</p>
<p>   * Bean to Cup Coffee<br />
   * Specialty Coffees<br />
   * Chocolates<br />
   * Fresh Brew Tea<br />
   * Cold Drinks</p>
<p>Snack machines will include a range of confectionery products and in addition a range of healthy options.<br />
Cold drinks - A choice of either bottled or cans will be available depending upon location.<br />
Cold Water - New mains fed water machines will be provided. </p></blockquote>
<p>I know it's nothing quite as posh as the Starbucks machine and free Coca-Cola Claire gets at work, but it's certainly better than the gnats piss we get from our machines now.</p>
<p>I'm interested to see what the "healthy options" will be.  I'm guessing something like an apple vending machine.  It'll also be interesting to see how the prices change: coffee/tea is currently free, but everything else is chargeable.  </p>
<p>Come to think of it, maybe this is the company's way of making us work harder.  More caffeine means more action.</p>
