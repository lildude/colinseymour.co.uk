<p><a href="https://www.southafrica.info">southafrica.info</a> has an <a href="https://www.southafrica.info/ess_info/sa_glance/constitution/identity-300606.htm">interesting article</a> on how most South Africans view themselves as neither, black, white, pink nor khaki, but rather as "South African", when asked to define their primary identity - that is, the group to which they belong "first and foremost". I couldn't agree more, I'm not white, I'm South African, now all we need to do is get the rest of the world to add this option.</p>
