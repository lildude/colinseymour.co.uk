<p>We've all heard the "Wimoweh" song, also known as "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" from The Lion King, but very few know it's history. </p>
<p>The song was originally called "Mbube", produced by a Zulu musician, Solomon Linda in 1939. It's estimated that Solomon received a total of 10 shillings for the song at the time, and since then the record companies have made millions with him and his faimly getting bugger all.  </p>
<p>Well, thanks to the Dickens Provision in the Copyright Act of Great Britain - and its former colonies, this has all changed. <a href="https://www.southafrica.info/what_happening/arts_entertainment/mbube-210206.htm">A settlement has been reached</a> with his family for back payment of past royalties and the right to receive future royalties.  No figures have been given, but I imagine it's got a lot of zeros.  </p>
<p>Oh, and it seems the author of the caption for the black and white image in the middle, can't tell his left from his right.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: The image caption has been changed, but it did say Solomon was on the far right, when he's actually on the far left.</p>
