<p>This is Barack Obama, who... "<em>this morning became the first black presidential nominee in American history, hours after his defeated rival Senator Hillary Clinton floated the proposal that she be his vice-presidential running mate</em>" (<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/democrats/2072756/Barack-Obama-limps-over-line-despite-Hillary-Clinton-South-Dakota-primary-victory.html">more</a>).</p>
<p>On <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_Day">my birthday</a> next year, he may just become the most powerful man in the world with one heck of a clean up job to do. Good luck to him.</p>
