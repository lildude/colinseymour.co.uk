<p><img class="alignright" src="/img/babyblender.jpg" alt="Baby Blender" height="200px" />How's this for a baby bath - the <a href="http://www.tummytub.co.uk/">Tummy Tub</a>.  Apparently it's meant to be womb-shaped and is meant to help with the transition from the womb to the real world. </p>
<p>Ermm, I may have ditched biology in favour of geography, but even I can tell it's more bucket-shaped than womb-shaped. Unfortunately, I'm a bit old to remember what it was like, and asking Lizzy is just pointless as she speaks a different language to me.</p>
<p>Anyway, the beauty of this little bath really comes to light when you put it on the stand it comes with... it starts to really look like a baby in a liquidiser and conjure up all those jokes we told as kids.</p>
