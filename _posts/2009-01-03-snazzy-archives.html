<p>Well, finally, after a very very long time, I've finally implemented a proper <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/archives/">archives</a> page, and boy is it sexy.  Thanks to the brilliant work of <a href="https://www.prelovac.com/">Vladimir Prelovac</a> and his <a href="https://www.prelovac.com/vladimir/wordpress-plugins/snazzy-archives">Snazzy Archives</a> plugin, I have some very snazzy archives too:</p>
<p><a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/archives/"><img src="/img/snazzyarchives.png" alt="Snazzy Archives" title="Snazzy Archives" width="500" height="417" class="center" /></a></p>
<p>Mosey on over to my <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/archives/">archives</a> page and be amazed by my snazzy archives.</p>
<p>This is the last "design" update to my site at it currently stands.  I plan to migrate the whole site across to <a href="https://www.habariproject.org">Habari</a> over the coming months.  This is going to take a fair amount of work as I'll need to port a fair few plugins, including this one, to Habari.  </p>
<p>I'll continue to post as normal, but you may notice some subtle and not so subtle changes along the way.</p>
