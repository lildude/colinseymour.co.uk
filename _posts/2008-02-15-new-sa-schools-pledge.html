<p>By March this year, schoolchildren all across South Africa could be reciting a new national schools' pledge during morning assemblies in an attempt to instill a renewed sense of morality in young South Africans.</p>
<p>Great idea, but you just know it's going to be a monotone drawl until you get to the last two lines...</p>

<blockquote>We the youth of South Africa,<br />
Recognising the injustices of our past,<br />
Honour those who suffered and sacrificed for justice and freedom.<br />
We will respect and protect the dignity of each person<br />
And stand up for justice.<br />
We sincerely declare that we shall uphold the rights and values of our Constitution,<br />
And promise to act in accordance with the duties and responsibilities that flow from these rights.<br />

<p>I know how to say the last line - it's in the national anthem - but how do I say the 2nd last line?</p>
