<p>Today is going to be a bit of a tough one for Claire and me, but hopefully not too tough. Today would have been Lara's first birthday. </p>
<div class="center" style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold">Happy Birthday Lara</div>
<p>You'll be in our minds forever.  Wish you were here with us.</p>
<p>All those parents out there lucky to have not lost a child, give your kids a big cuddle today, tell them how much you love them and spare a thought for those who can't.</p>
