<p>So the opposition kicks off after you've just scored a try.  One of your team mates leaps into the air in front of you, with a little boost from you to get some extra altitude and then it happens: they over reach backwards and start to feel the effects of gravity as they start falling back-first towards the ground.  So what does <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendai_Mtawarira" target="_blank">Beast</a> do?</p>

<p>Yes, he holds on tight and then flips his team mate back up right and carries on.  </p>
<p>Anton Bresler, the listee, weighs in at 112kg.  I can't lift 112kg anymore, let alone lift it above my head, hold it there for a bit and then return it to the upright position.  Tendai Mtawarira is one heck of a strong player.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> It would appear this isn't the first time Tendai has used his strength in this exact situation.  He saved his captain at the time, Keegan Daniel, in the same manner...</p>
