<p><img class="alignleft" src="/assets/pinkcricketball.jpg" alt="Pink Cricket Ball" />The face of cricket may be changing to pink.  The powers that be at the MCC (the guardians of the rules of cricket) are in the process of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/7092114.stm">starting trials of a pink cricket ball</a>, with the hopes it will replace the white ball used in Day/Night, Twenty20 and one-day international cricket by 2009.</p>
<p>The reasoning is quite simple.  The red ball lasts a long time - about 80 overs - however the white ball lasts less than half that before it starts dulling severely and becoming increasingly hard to see as the paint wears off the leather.  It's also a bit difficult to see it against floodlights. The MCC gurus are hoping the pink ball is the answer and have asked Kookaburra to produce a batch for testing over the winter.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how the tests go.  Who knows, maybe one day <em>every</em> little boy will want a pink cricket ball.</p>
