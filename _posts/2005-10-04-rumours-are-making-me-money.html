<p><img class="alignleft" src="https://static.flickr.com/25/49352263_98fe34aa8f_o.jpg" alt="Sun / Google Logo" />Sun is currently <a href="https://www.sun.com/events/google/">advertising</a> a joint Sun/Google news conference that will be held today.  Jonathan Swartz hinted that something big is coming in his blog entry on <a href="https://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan?entry=the_world_changes_this_week">Saturday</a> with the comment "<em>If I were a betting man, I'd bet the world was about to change</em>" and now the rumours are out.  </p>
<p>Rumour has it, Sun and Google will announce a web based Office Suite based on <a href="https://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a>.</p>
<p>I can't say if there is any truth in the rumour, however I can say that the Sun share price is doing damn well thanks to all these rumours - the market has only been open an hour and the Sun shares have already jumped $0.34 to $4.53 - the highest it's been in ages.  If the price keeps going up, we'll be back over that $5.00 barrier by the end of the day.... woohooo!!! </p>
<p>Next stop - $10.00 a share please.</p>
