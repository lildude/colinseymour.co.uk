<p>So you're driving along the road on your way home from the hardware store minding your own business until a little thought pops into your mind... "<em>Should I really have put that on the backseat?  Aggh, it'll be fine.  We're nearly home now</em>" and with that <strong>THUMP!!!</strong></p>

<figcaption>Where NOT to put 25 litre of paint in the car</figcaption>

<p>Yes folks, the answer was NO, you should not have put the 25 litre bucket of PVC paint on the back seat of the car just in case something like this happens.</p>
<p>This accident really took place on <a href="http://maps.google.co.za/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&q=St+Johns+Ave,+Pinetown,+Durban+Metro,+KwaZulu-Natal+3610&sll=-28.45,24.7&sspn=32.490155,53.129883&ie=UTF8&oi=georefine&cd=1&geocode=FZ4AOf4dbvrWAQ&split=0&hq=&hnear=St+Johns+Ave,+New+Germany,+Pinetown,+Durban+Metro,+KwaZulu-Natal+3610&ll=-29.822635,30.864329&spn=0.007902,0.012971&z=17&layer=c&cbll=-29.821824,30.86468&panoid=8YAHdoEwJoI3_nKxByJxmA&cbp=12,115.43,,0,5" target="_blank">St John's Avenue, Pinetown, Kwazulu Natal, South Africa</a> and wasn't staged.  Apparently the ambulance driver of the ambulance that attended wouldn't let the female paramedic out of the ambulance because she couldnâ€™t stop laughing. He said it wasn't professional.</p>
<p>I wonder how the insurance company will treat this one.  The exterior damage to the car doesn't look too bad, but it's pure carnage inside the car.</p>
<p>Thanks for the photos and details mum.</p>
