<p>If you plan on traveling the 80-odd miles from Kettering in Northamptonshire, to London St Pancras on Saturday 23 May 2009, you may want to think again.</p>
<p>Due to engineering work, this just-over 1 hour journey will be taking you a mammoth 18 hours and will include no less than seven changes, five bus journeys, a kip on a station floor and a trip on the London Underground.</p>
<p>Here's the official route for the 295 mile journey, courtesy of <a href="https://www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk/emtrains">East Midlands Trains</a>:</p>

<p>Given this, it will literally be quicker to cycle, maybe even walk, into London on that day.</p>
<p>For those of you not traveling from Kettering, you may still want to check your local rail company website as bank holiday weekends are notoriously bad for rail travel.</p>
