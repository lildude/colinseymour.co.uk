[Good Calories, Bad Calories by Gary Taubes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Calories,_Bad_Calories) is an interesting book, but my word is it a long book. I think the slow reading pace of the audiobook is exasperating that. Iâ€™ve just bumped the speed up to 2.5x and I can still understand and follow along without problems.
