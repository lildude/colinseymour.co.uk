<p>From my own experience, searching the web, the comments I've received in my previous two posts(<a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/blog/vibram-five-fingers/">Vibram Five Fingers</a> and <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/blog/vibram-five-fingers-1-month-later/">Vibram Five Fingers: 1 Month Later</a>) and in conversation, sizing the Vibram Five Fingers is quite a concern and challenge. This is understandable as they're not shoes in the sense we know it and they need to be snug. If they're too big, you will notice.</p>
<p>Well, here's my guide to sizing the Vibram Five Finger Classics based on my own experience.  Your experience may vary.</p>
<ol>
<li>Measure your feet in inches (I know, metric makes much more sense, but you'll understand why in a mo) and the take the largest of the two and round down to the nearest &frac14; inch.</li>
<li>Take this figure and locate the appropriate size on the sizing chart on the Vibrams US site <a href="http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/size_conversion_chart.html">here</a>. This is why you need to measure your feet in inches.</li>
<li>Order the size one smaller than the chart recommends.  For example, if like me you largest foot came in between 11 inches and 11&frac14; inches, round down to 11 inches which equates to a size 44  and then order the 43.</li>
</ol>
<p>I know this sounds odd, but this is what I've had to do. The 44's were way too big.</p>
<p>Hopefully this saves you a bit of time and removes the need to have to send your order back for a smaller pair.</p>
<p>Let me know how you get on with these instructions.  All comments will help others who come to buy their own pair of Vibram Five Fingers.</p>
