<p>After Jacob Zuma was cleared of rape charges several months ago, he's now decided to <a href="http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Zuma/0,,2-7-1840_1962163,00.html">sue the media</a> for a whopping R63m (Â£4.7m / $8.8m / â‚¬6.8m) for defamation. This may not be much when you convert it to other currencies, but it's a huge amount in Rands.  Of this, there is a claim against the Jonathan Shapiro, better known as cartoonist Zapiro for R15m claiming several of his cartoons slandered Zuma's reputation.  Quite aptly, Zapiro responded with "<a href="http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Zuma/0,,2-7-1840_1964091,00.html">What reputation?</a>" and summed up the whole ordeal with this cartoon in the Star newspaper on Thursday:</p>

<p>Wakey wakey Mr Zuma - you're in South Africa, not the US.  SA courts don't hand out judgements for silly amounts of money like this.</p>
