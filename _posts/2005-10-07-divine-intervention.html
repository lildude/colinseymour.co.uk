<p>The truth is out... all the war in Afghanistan and the invasion of Iraq weren't driven by the need for oil or just because George Bush wanted to be a war president.  In fact, they were caused by George just doing as he was told by a far superior power... the only far superior power... God.</p>
<p>In a new BBC series, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/10_october/06/bush.shtml">Elusive Peace: Israel and the Arabs</a>,  Nabil Shaath (the Palestinian Foreign Minister) says: </p>
<blockquote><p>President Bush said to all of us: 'I'm driven with a mission from God. God would tell me, "George, go and fight those terrorists in Afghanistan." And I did, and then God would tell me, "George, go and end the tyranny in Iraq" And I did. And now, again, I feel God's words coming to me, "Go get the Palestinians their state and get the Israelis their security, and get peace in the Middle East." And by God I'm gonna do it.'</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmmm, me thinks Georgie has been telling porkies again.</p>
