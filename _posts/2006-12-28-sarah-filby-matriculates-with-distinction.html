<p>I am proud to announce that exactly 10 years after I matriculated, my cousin Sarah has just matriculated with distinction:</p>

<p>This is made up of 4 A's and 2 B's with an average of over 80%. Congratulations Sarah - you're a true boff, despite the blonde moment when you thought it would be a good idea to call my phone at 5:58am this morning ;-) .</p>
