<p>Think wheat, even whole-wheat is good for you?  Have a read of this and the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mark-hyman/wheat-gluten_b_1274872.html" target="_blank">article</a> from which it comes and think about it again...</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mark-hyman/wheat-gluten_b_1274872.html"><p>It is not just the amount but also the hidden components of wheat that drive weight gain and disease. This is not the wheat your great-grandmother used to bake her bread. It is FrankenWheat -- a scientifically engineered food product developed in the last 50 years.</p>
<p><strong>How Wheat -- and Gluten -- Trigger Weight Gain, Prediabetes, Diabetes and More</strong></p>
<p>This new modern wheat may look like wheat, but it is different in three important ways that all drive obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, dementia and more.</p>
<ol>
<li>It contains a <strong>Super Starch</strong> -- amylopectin A that is super fattening.</li>
<li>It contains a form of <strong>Super Gluten</strong> that is super-inflammatory.</li>
<li>It contains forms of a <strong>Super Drug</strong> that is super-addictive and makes you crave and eat more.</li>
</ol>

<p>Great article that effectively sums up a lot of the information in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1609611543/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1609611543&linkCode=as2&tag=colsey-21" target="_blank">Wheat Belly</a> which is a great book and definitely worth a read, even if you're not a coeliac or even think you have a wheat intolerance.</p>
<p>Actually come to think of it: I challenge you, the reader, to give up wheat entirely (don't substitute it with gluten free products either) for 3 weeks and tell me how you look and feel at the end.  Then I want you to eat two slices of whole-wheat toast or a sandwich or a normal bowl of pasta and then tell me how you feel a few hours later :-)</p>
<p>If you don't notice a difference, especially a few hours after eating wheat again, then all you've lost is 3 weeks of wheat in your life.  If however you do notice a difference, then maybe it's time to drop the wheat, or at least cut down on wheat significantly.</p>
