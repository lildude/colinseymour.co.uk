<p>Falbum <a href="http://www.randombyte.net/blog/2005/11/16/falbum-054/">0.5.4</a> is out now, and it's got all my recent changes.  Go grab it now and update. It fixes a lot of problems with 0.5.3, integrates with K2 better and now reports more meaningful errors if things go wrong.</p>
<p>Word of warning to all people upgrading from previous versionsâ€¦. to make the upgrade go smoothly, make sure you deactivate your old version BEFORE you install the new version. This is because the table name used by Falbum now uses your Wordpress prefix, and as such, the new table is only created when you activate the plugin.</p>
<p>Don't say I didn't warn you if you get problems.</p>
