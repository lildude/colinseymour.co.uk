<p>Oh, it was so terrible, we <em>weren't</em> woken in the middle of the night, <em>no</em> pictures fell off the wall, <em>no</em> new cracks appeared and our chimney <em>is still</em> right where we left it.  The aftermath of <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7267567.stm">last night's earthquake</a> is so terrible, I just don't know how we're going to cope ;-) . We didn't feel a thing.</p>
