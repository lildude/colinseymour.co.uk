<p>First <a href="http://www.labradoodle.org.uk/">labradoodles</a>, now <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/science.ars/2006/6/9/4278">hypoallergenic cats</a>.  Is there any animal we won't cross-breed to resolve human allergy problems? Why don't we just stick to the old principles - got an allergy to cats? Well don't get a cat then.</p>
