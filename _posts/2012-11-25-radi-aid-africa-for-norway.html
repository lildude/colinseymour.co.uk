<p>Saw this the other day and thought: what a brilliant idea...</p>

<p>No, not the sending of radiators to Norway, but the idea about changing the image of Africa the rest of the world has of it.  To quote <a href="https://www.africafornorway.no/why" target="_blank">Radi-Aid website</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine if every person in Africa saw the “Africa for Norway” video and this was the only information they ever got about Norway. What would they think about Norway?</p>
<p>If we say Africa, what do you think about? Hunger, poverty, crime or AIDS? No wonder, because in fundraising campaigns and media that’s mainly what you hear about.</p>
<p>The pictures we usually see in fundraisers are of poor African children. Hunger and poverty is ugly, and it calls for action. But while these images can engage people in the short term, we are concerned that many people simply give up because it seems like nothing is getting better. Africa should not just be something that people either give to, or give up on.</p>
<p>The truth is that there are many positive developments in African countries, and we want these to become known. We need to change the simplistic explanations of problems in Africa. We need to educate ourselves on the complex issues and get more focus on how western countries have a negative impact on Africa’s development. If we want to address the problems the world is facing we need to do it based on knowledge and respect.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is starting as a small initiative in Norway, but it would be great to see this spread across the world and initiatives like Comic Relief adopting a more complete portrayal of Africa.</p>
