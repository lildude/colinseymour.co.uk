<p>You've got to love the BBC's imagery in their <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8021958.stm">Q&amp;A</a> for the current <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8024039.stm">swine flu break out</a> that is all over the news.</p>
<p>First they kindly depict the 3 different types of flu...</p>
<p><img src="/img/swine-flu-1.gif" alt="Swine Flu (1)" class="center" /></p>
<p>Then they detail antigenic drift and antigenic shift (slide 2) and then slide 3 has this picture...</p>

<p>Hmmmm.... bird flu + swine flu + human flu = flying pig with a running nose?</p>
<p>Or more precisely...</p>

<p>That didn't take long.</p>
