<p>So jet lag has me wide awake watching American TV at 3am and I've just seen an advert for a testosterone roll-on!! The list of who the product is NOT for, warnings - careful hugging your dad kids, you may go through puberty at 5 - and the side effects - surprisingly various forms of cancer are clearly mentioned - is longer than the blurb about why you would want to get your doctor to prescribe it for you. This whole concept of advertising prescription drugs on TV is still alien to me.</p>
