<p>I received an email a couple of months ago from a guy at <a href="https://www.schmap.com/">Schmap</a> saying that he'd found several of the pictures I took when we went to Bath on <a href="https://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>, and would like to know if I was happy for them to be included in their guide for Bath.</p>
<p>I'm a nice guy, so I agreed - I'm not some professional photographer trying to make a buck off every photo I take after all.</p>
<p>Well, I received an email yesterday to say <a href="https://www.schmap.com/photos/p=24148533N00/c=SC100485">5 of my pictures</a> had been included in the Bath Schmap guide.  Cool!!</p>
<p>So, if you're running Windows, <a href="https://www.schmap.com/photos/p=24148533N00/c=SC100485">download</a> the player and see if you can find my pictures.</p>
