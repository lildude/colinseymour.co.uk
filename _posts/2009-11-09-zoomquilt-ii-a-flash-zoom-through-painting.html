<p><a href="http://zoomquilt2.madmindworx.com/" target="_blank">Zoomquilt II</a> is a Flash zoom-through collaborative painting with images contributed by more than 30 different artists and merged into an almost hypnotic dream-like sequence. </p>
<p>You start off at a screen which looks like the screenshot above and then zoom in towards the middle.  As you get closer and closer, more and more detail is revealed from the middle of the picture.  This continues until you eventually loop round back to the start.  </p>
<p>This is pretty impressive and the detail people have gone to is fantastic.  If you really like it, you can even grab a it at a screensaver for Windows too.</p>
