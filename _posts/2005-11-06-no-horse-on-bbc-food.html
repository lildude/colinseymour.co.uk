<p>The other day Claire mentioned that BBC Food has improved their recipe search fascility so that you could search by ingredient and then narrow your search down further.  My warped mind instantly thought of testing it for horse... so this morning, that's what I did, just to satisfy my curiosity.</p>
<p>Well, sorry to disappoint folks - no fine French horse cuisine recipes from the Beeb.  For the curious, the closest it got was "horse mushrooms" used in two recipes.</p>
