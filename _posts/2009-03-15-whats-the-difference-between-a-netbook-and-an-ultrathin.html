<p>Warning: this is a bit of a technical post, but not quite technical enough for the <a href="https://www.lildude.co.uk/">hardcore</a> (as they're all likely to have seen it on <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/03/13/miniature_computer_field_guide/">The Register</a> already), but may be useful to those looking at getting a laptop/netbook/ultrathin/ultraportable/handheld computer, or those who've already got one and wish to categorise it correctly. </p>
<p>Thanks to the wonderful world of computing, and now <a href="https://www.reghardware.co.uk/2009/03/02/psion_countersues_intel/">litigation</a>, there are many different terms used for those super-small and lightweight "laptops" that you can fit in your handbag/coat pocket, but how do you know which one you've got or want?</p>
<p>Well thanks to The Register, this flow humorous flow diagram should answer all your questions and help you determine what type of little laptop you have.</p>
