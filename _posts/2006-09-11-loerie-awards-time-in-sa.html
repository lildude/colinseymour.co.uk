It's that time again in South Africa - it's time to vote for the <a href="https://loeries.24.com/">Loerie Awards</a> (ie vote for your favourite advert). I can't say all of the adverts up for voting are that good, but three of the radio adverts made me laugh: </p>
<p><a href="https://loeries.24.com/cake/loeries/files/clips/31/flash6_high.swf">Opel Corsa</a><br />
<a href="https://loeries.24.com/cake/loeries/files/clips/29/flash6_high.swf">Twinsaver</a><br />
<a href="https://loeries.24.com/cake/loeries/files/clips/37/flash6_high.swf">Geronimo Condoms</a></p>
<p>I've linked directly to the clips as the Loeries site needs you to register in order to listen and vote. If you live in SA, go ahead, register and get voting. The Geronimo Condoms one gets my vote.</p>
<p>I really do think SA has one up on the UK when it comes to imaginative ads.</p>
