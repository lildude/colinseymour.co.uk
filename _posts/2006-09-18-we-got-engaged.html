<p>On 5 September 2006 at approximately 17:05, at the view point in the Wild Nature Reserve, further up the hill from God's Window, just outside Graskop, Mpumalanga, South Africa, approximately 1829m above sea level, over looking the lowveld forests and the Kruger National Park in the distance, I proposed to Claire and she accepted.</p>
<p>This weekend we went and did a bit of shopping, and look what we came home with:</p>

<p>It's 18 carat white gold, with a 0.25 carat Princess cut diamond (Clarity: SI1, Colour: G).</p>
<p>I've added more pics to my <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/gallery/">gallery</a>. Enjoy.</p>
