<p>Well, after my little breakage last week, I warn you now, there may be another one coming soon :-)  <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2005/02/strayhorn/">Wordpress 1.5</a> is out and the changes look good.  It'll make my life administering and updating this site much much easier with it's many enhancements.</p>
<p>I might even go for a new look too, but think I'll work on the upgrade first.</p>
