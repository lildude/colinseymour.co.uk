<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.good.is/post/rental-goats-clear-brush-better-beat-cosmonauts-in-space-race/">Rental Goats Clear Brush Better</a> - What a brilliant idea.  I think I need to get myself a few goats and start renting them out to our local council.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boingboing.net/2009/10/28/arnold-schwarzenegge.html">Arnold Schwarzenegger's coded F-bomb in veto - Boing Boing</a> - Hee hee hee.  Co-incidence?  Only Arnie knows.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article6896049.ece">Denying physics wonâ€™t save the video stars | Cory Doctorow - Times Online</a> - Another stupid UK gov proposal: The section "<em>what if Peter Mandelson proposed a rule to terminate the internet access of any movie studio or record company accused of three baseless copyright claims against the public?</em>" raises a question: what if said movie companies just receive 3 baseless copyright infringement claims?  Do they get cut off too?  Probably not.</li>
<li><a href="https://crave.cnet.co.uk/gadgets/0,39029552,49303764-1,00.htm">Plug versus Plug - Crave at CNET UK</a> - Yes folks, this is a comparison of 10 countries' plugs.  Some people have far too much time.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.techcrunch.com/2009/11/09/exclusive-google-has-acquired-gizmo5/">Exclusive: Google Has Acquired Gizmo5</a> - Ooooo, this could be a good thing.  I'm a big user of Gizmo (to phone family in SA) however I've felt it a bit lacking and slow in development at times.  Hopefully Google will work it's magic and this will become the SIP client of choice for most people.</li>
