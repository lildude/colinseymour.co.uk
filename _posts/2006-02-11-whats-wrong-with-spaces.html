<p>Why O why do soooo many web developers have a problem with spaces?  Why do more and more websites insist that you put in your credit card details without any spaces?  The spaces are there on the card for easy verification, so why can't web site designers write one more line of code (if that) to strip the damn spaces. Come on peeps, removing spaces is really easy - I can think of ways of removing single spaces in at least 5 programming languages off the top of my head, and I'm wouldn't call myself competent in half of those.</p>
