<p>Nope, not a single one, unless you consider "ass" as a profanity.  Yup, you guessed it, within days of releasing OpenSolaris, people have already been scrounging through the source code (<a href="https://cvs.opensolaris.org/source/">source code browser</a>) looking for profanities, but without much luck.</p>
<p>The closest they could find was:</p>
<blockquote><p>This bit me in the ass a couple of times, so lets toss this in as a cursory sanity check</p></blockquote>
<p>... in the actual Solaris code.  There was a "crap" in the Perl code, but this is not developed by Sun, just supplied as part of OpenSolaris.</p>
<p>This article lists several others amusing quotes including a quote from Lord of the Rings and a reference to an extract from Monty Python.  My favourite has to be in a bit of code from the GRUB (boot loader) source...</p>
<blockquote><p>This function is truly horrid... we try opening the device, then severely abuse the GEOMETRY->flags field to pass a file descriptor to biosdisk. Thank God nobody's looking at this comment, or my reputation would be ruined.</p></blockquote>
