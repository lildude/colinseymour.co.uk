<p>After the news that Tesco may lose their alcohol license after <a href="http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/2001/2001643/tesco_alcohol_licence_threat">3 stores in Reading sold a 15 year old booze</a>, it seems they're now actively encouraging it as a <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/05/19/rum_offer/">form of contraceptive</a>.</p>
