<p>I've <strong>finally</strong> finished sorting, tagging, titling, describing and uploading the 800-odd photos I took when I visited San Francisco for a work conference in October last year. They are all available for your perusal in my <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/gallery/">gallery</a>.  Don't worry, you won't need to book the next 3 days off work to view them all - I managed to whittle the number down to a mere 258 photos. Enjoy.</p>
<p>Now I'd done these, I think I'm finally bang up to date with all my recent images.  Now I can continue working on my replacement for FAlbum (the code that runs my gallery) and the redesign of my site.</p>
