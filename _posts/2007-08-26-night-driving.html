<p>Last night, on the way home from work, was the first time I've driven my car in the dark. Once again, I was impressed by the little things.  </p>
<p>The automatic dimming interior rear-view mirror is pretty cool and works really well. Bright light coming in through the rear windscreen seems to activate a darkening filter which appears to cut out the glare using a sort of green filter.  This works very quickly and makes driving a lot more comfortable, especially if you've got a twit with misaligned headlights behind you.</p>
<p>There are also two little red LEDs that shed a nice red glow over the gear stick which I can only assume is to make it easier to find in the dark ;-) . I'm not sure of the function of this, but I think it's quite cool.</p>
