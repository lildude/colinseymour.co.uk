<blockquote cite="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/george-hobica/the-things-airlines-dont-_b_2572829.html">Have you ever wondered exactly why airlines dim the lights upon landing, making you grope to find the overhead light just as you were about to finish your Sudoku? (Hint: It's not to save electricity. Read the answer at the end of this article.) Or why it's so important to put your own oxygen mask on before helping others? Or what's it like jumping onto a 737's inflatable emergency slide? And just how heavy are those over-wing exit doors?<br />

<p>I've thought about these things in the past and now I've read this article I don't need to pay BA £162 to find out, though I'm sure they tell you a lot more than this article does.  That said, it's tempting to see if we can get a team building event just so we can go down one of the slides and throw a door out the window :-)</p>
