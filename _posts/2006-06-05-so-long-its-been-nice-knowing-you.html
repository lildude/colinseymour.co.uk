<p>Just in case tomorrow really is the end of the world - it is 06/06/06 after all (666 - sign of the beast and all) - I thought I'd get in early and say cheerio, it's been nice knowing you. I'll try my best to blog from heaven (they've got loads of computers in my heaven) so be sure to keep reading.</p>
