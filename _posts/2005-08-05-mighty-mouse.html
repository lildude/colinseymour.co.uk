<p>Apple have finally entered the same computer era that the rest of the world has been in for ages and released a 3 button mouse.  For those who don't know, Apple historically went with the approach that a single mouse button and a key press click was way better than a 2 or 3 button mouse. How they were wrong - I even use an  MS mouse on my Mac Mini because I just couldn't get to grips with the single button and mouse click.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the topic of their new mouse - it's quite a fancy mouse that looks like it has only one button, but has the functionality of 3.  It does this with touch sensors and other fancy jiggery pokery that I'm not going to go into.  This is all quite impressive, and the Apple marketeers think so too, so they named it the "Might Mouse".  However, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/telemarkskier/30939601/">this guy</a> does have a point - it's a poor bit of marketing, everyone knows Danger Mouse would kick Might Mouses arse anyday of the week :-D</p>
<p>Here's the image from the previous link showing how they could have marketed it had they called it Danger Mouse compared to how they have marketed it (click images for larger view):</p>
