<p>It's a sad day today for anyone who grew up in the 80's: two icons of the era have both died; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8256033.stm">Patrick Swayze</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8256260.stm">Keith Floyd</a>; and sadly both of them from cancer.</p>
<p>I can't say I was influenced by Patrick Swayze too much - the two movies he was famous for - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00004YA8P?ie=UTF8&tag=costest-21">Dirty Dancing</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00005NFXD?ie=UTF8&tag=costest-21">Ghost</a> - are both "chick flicks" and whilst I've watched both, neither have made it only my list of must watch again movies.</p>
<p>Keith Floyd on the other hand is an institution in my life.  I've watched his flamboyant cooking programs ever since I was a little boy and sometimes even employ his "one for the pot and one for me" method of cooking with wine - every meal cooked by Keith Floyd was cooked with wine, maybe not in the dish itself, but certainly in his hand.  That said, he comes to my mind regularly for a completely different reason; everytime I cook pasta, I always remember as spaghetti advert he did with the catch phrase "<em>Two minutes have passed and look at this...</em>" at which point he throws a piece of spaghetti onto the ceiling and it sticks.  I don't throw the spaghetti but I certainly almost always say or think this.</p>
<p>Of course neither man will completely die.  The sales of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00004YA8P?ie=UTF8&tag=costest-21">Dirty Dancing</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00005NFXD?ie=UTF8&tag=costest-21">Ghost</a> are likely to see a revival and Keith Floyd is already continually repeated on the golden-oldy TV channels.</p>
