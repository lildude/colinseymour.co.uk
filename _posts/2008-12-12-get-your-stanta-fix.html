<p>I was a little disappointed to hear on the radio this morning that Radio 1 would not be playing <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chrismoyles/">Chris Moyles's</a> <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/blog/stanta/">Stanta</a> parody this year. I'm sure I'm not the only one.  So if you're after a bit of <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/blog/stanta/">Stanta</a> action, I've got it over <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/blog/stanta/">here</a>.</p>
