<p>In an attempt to make people believe they have a say in the direction of this country, the Prime Minister's Office has setup a <a href="https://petitions.pm.gov.uk/">section</a> on the <a href="https://www.pm.gov.uk/">PM's website</a> where individuals can register a petition of their choice.</p>
<p>The most newsworthy petition so far has been the <a href="https://petitions.pm.gov.uk/traveltax/">Road Pricing Petition</a> and the only one I know of that has actually got a <a href="https://www.pm.gov.uk/output/Page11050.asp">response from Tony Blair</a>.  Which is a shame as I'd love to read his response to some of the other petitions like the following <a href="https://petitions.pm.gov.uk/list/open?sort=deadline">Open Petitions</a> (up to an including today):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://petitions.pm.gov.uk/NewsFiction/">Ban the use of actual TV newscasters in fictional programmes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://petitions.pm.gov.uk/PMQstoPMAs/">Change the Name of Prime Minister's Question Time</a></li>
<li><a href="https://petitions.pm.gov.uk/29febpubhol/">Create a 29th Feb Public Holiday to be taken once every 4 years</a></li>
<li><a href="https://petitions.pm.gov.uk/lefthand/">end the stigmatisation of, and material discrimination against, left-handed people</a></li>
<li><a href="https://petitions.pm.gov.uk/NHS-Tea/">Make Tea and Digestives free on the NHS to improve social interaction</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You think these are stupid? You should see the list of <a href="https://petitions.pm.gov.uk/list/rejected?sort=deadline">Rejected Petitions</a> - some of these are blatantly people taking the piss, but others are unbelievable.  It's well worth the read.  It's the funniest thing you'll ever read on a government website.</p>
