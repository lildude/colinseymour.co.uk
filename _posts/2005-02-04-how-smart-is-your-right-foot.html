<p>Got this in an email from Claire the other day and I thought it pretty cool.</p>
<p>While sitting at your desk, lift your right foot off the floor and make clockwise circles with it.</p>
<p>Now, while doing this, draw the number "6" in the air with your right hand. Your foot will change direction. </p>
<p>It works for lefties too, just use your left foot and hand.</p>
<p>Crazy huh?</p>
