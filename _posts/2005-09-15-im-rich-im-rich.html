<p><strong>WOOHOO!!! I'M RICH. VERY RICH. RICH BEYOND MY WILDEST DREAMS!!!!<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>Â£1 955 815.85 worth of rich.</strong></p>
<p>I think the first thing I'm going to do is by a Ferrari and then maybe a huge big house in Beaconsfield or Wokingham with a 3 bedroom granny flat for mum and Sami to live in.  Then I'll take Claire on a fabulous holiday to the Seyschelles - we'll fly first class of course.  Actually, cancel the Seyschelles, that's so last year - we'll do a round the world trip and stay as the top hotels of EVERY country in the world.</p>
<p>I'm so excited, I can hardly contain myself.</p>

<p>I absolutely hate spam, but I couldn't resist.  I've read articles warning people against these spam emails, but I hadn't received one.  Now I've received two in the same day. How lucky am I?</p>
<p>Of course there's the usual inaccuracies, like purporting to be from a legitimate company, yet the emails are sent from a Hotmail address.  The 2nd email is particularily good with it's "facts" - it's "from" the  UK National Lottery Company, but the prize fund is in dollars and I've got to collect is from an agent in South Africa - and of course there are the usual "Don't tell anyone" clauses in both.  Well, sorry you wishful thinking, scaly buggers - I've just popped your emails onto the net for the world to read.  </p>
<p>Now, I wonder if I should reply to these and see how long I can string this out for before they realise I'm onto them.</p>
