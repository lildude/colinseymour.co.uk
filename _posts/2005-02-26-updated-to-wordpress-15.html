<p>Well, that was nice and easy.  The upgrade to <a href="https://wordpress.org/development/2005/02/strayhorn/">Wordpress 1.5</a> is complete and was relatively pain free.  I had to change a couple of my static pages so they called the new <code>get_header()</code> and <code>get_footer()</code> functions and update my <code>.htaccess</code> file.  But once all that was done, it all works a treat.</p>
<p>If you spot any problems, be sure to let me know by commenting on this entry. Thanks</p>
