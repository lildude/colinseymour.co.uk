<p>In this day and age where everything is on the internet for convenience so you can access your information, money, data, whatever 24x7 I stumbled upon the fact that parts of the Standard Life website have working hours.</p>
<p>I've got a little spare time on my hands whilst I'm working in San Francisco at OpenWorld and I thought I'd check up on my pension.  Unfortunately, I can't remember my Standard Life user ID so I clicked the "Forgotten your user ID?" link and this window appeared:</p>
<p><img class="center" alt="Standard Life's website working hours" src="/img/Standard-Lifes-website-working-hours.png" width="717" height="646" /></p>
<p>Huh!?  How can something so simple and easily automated have working hours?  The same thing applies for the registration page. I think someone at Standard Life hasn't quite worked out this whole 24x7 internet convenience thing.</p>
