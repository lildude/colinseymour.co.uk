<p>It's that time of year again when everyone is pulling out their great big boxes of outdoor Christmas lights and decorating their houses for all to see.  As ever, some are just pure tack look it, whilst others show a little bit of class and actual decorative style.  But NONE I've ever seen have been converted into a game. Yes a game: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb%255Fss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dguitar%2520hero%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&tag=costest-21&linkCode=ur2&camp=1634&creative=19450">Guitar Hero</a>, but in Christmas lights...</p>
<div class="center"><object width="480" height="295" data="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/bXjbMIZzAgs&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/bXjbMIZzAgs&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/bXjbMIZzAgs&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="295" /></object></div>
<p>Now that is impressive. <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/12/christmas_light_hero.html">Make Magazine</a> has all the details of how this was done and how this chap managed to get 21 268 lights and LEDs all synced up and playing nicely, oh and people driving past can listen to the music on their car radios too whilst enjoying the spectacle.</p>
