<p>See, I <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/blog/the-banking-world-is-crumbling/">told you Friday or Monday would be a good day to bung your money into an index tracker ISA</a>.  Check what the FTSE 100 has done today:</p>

<p>You'd have made yourself an easy 7.58% in one day. This of course assumes your ISA company invests your money at the beginning of the day, and not the end like mine.</p>
