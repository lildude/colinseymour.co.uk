<p>What would you say if I told you I could sell you an appetite-control agent that requires no prescription, has no common side effects, costs very little (ie is incredibly cheap) and is very effective? </p>
<p>"<em>How much and where do I send my money?</em>"</p>
<p>As I'm a nice guy, I won't take your money, instead I'll direct you to someone else who will gladly take your cash: Coca-Cola and your local water board. Yes folks, the magic elixir is WATER. Good ol' H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
<blockquote><p>Scientists yesterday reported results of a new clinical trial confirming that just two 8-ounce (~225ml) glasses of the stuff, taken before meals, enables people to shed pounds.<br />

<p>So there you have it folks, 2 glasses of water before every meal will help you lose weight and won't break the bank at the same time, unless of course you insist on drinking two glasses of <a href="http://www.blingh2o.com/" target="_blank">this stuff</a> 3 times a day :-)</p>
