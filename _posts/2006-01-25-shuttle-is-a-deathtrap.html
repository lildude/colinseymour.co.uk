<p>One of America's most experienced astronauts has <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/story/0,,1692153,00.html">denounced the space shuttle as a deathtrap</a>. Well, duh.  Having that much rocket fuel inches from your arse is bound to be dangerous - even playing with matches is dangerous. And that's not to mention the <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/foam-space-shuttles">chunks of foam attached to the rocket</a>. Sorry dude, call me a wuss, but you aren't going to see me getting a lift in a space shuttle anytime soon.</p>
