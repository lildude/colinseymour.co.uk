<p><img class="alignleft" src="/img/SchmapLogo.png" alt="Schmap Logo" /><a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/ive-been-schmapped">Last year I received a request</a> asking if several of the pictures I took in Bath could be included in the <a href="http://www.schmap.com/bath">Bath Schmap Guide</a>, and was then <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/schmapped-rev-2">informed</a> that some of them had made it again into the 2nd rev.  Well, today I received an email asking if they could use one of my pictures from Rome in the 3rd edition of their <a href="http://www.schmap.com/Rome">Rome guide</a>.</p>
<p>All I have to do now is wait and see if they include it in the final guide.  I doubt they will as it's not one of the best pictures I've taken, but we'll have to wait and see</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Woohoo!! My <a href="http://www.schmap.com/rome/activities_pantheon/p=12321/i=12321_1.jpg">one pic</a> has made it into rev 3 of the Rome guide.</p>
