<p>This afternoon, I decided it was about time I harvested out potatoes.  They've been growing in the 1m&sup3; lined cane box in the corner of our balcony for several months now and the foliage has pretty much drooped and was almost dead.</p>
<p>Check 'em out...</p>

<p>12 affordable seed potatoes produced a fantastic crop of 1.75Kg. I'm sure if I followed all the "grow your own potatoes" suggestions we'd have got a larger crop.  That'll be the challenge for next summer.</p>
<p>Next up for harvesting: our balcony beef tomatoes.</p>
