<p>It was about this time last year that I <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/only-foreigners-need-pass-natives-can-bask-in-ignorance">mentioned the UK was bringing in a Britishness test</a> for all them jolly foreigners who want to be British (at least those that don't already have a purple book).  Well, I've finally found someone who's actually gone through and documented this whole procedure, and he's a fellow Saffer.  Check out BigGuy's <a href="https://businesstraveller.wordpress.com/2006/11/21/how-to-become-british-an-idiots-guide-written-by-a-newly-british-idiot/">Idiot's Guide to Becoming British</a>. Even if you're already British, or already have your little purple book, check it out for a good laugh.</p>
