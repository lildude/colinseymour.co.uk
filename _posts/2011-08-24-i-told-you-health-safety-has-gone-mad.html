<p>Today, <a href="https://www.chrisgrayling.net/" target="_blank">Chris Grayling MP</a> released a list of the top 10 most bizarre and absurd <del>excuses</del> bans imposed under the guise of "health and safety".  </p>
<p>I heard about this on the news this morning and had to hunt down the list.  It didn't take me long to <a href="https://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/16055527" target="_blank">find it</a> and here it is for your pleasure...</p>
<ol>
<li>Murray Mount closed at Wimbledon because of rain</li>
<li>Butlins ban on dodgem cars from bumping into each other</li>
<li>A ban on Royal wedding street parties</li>
<li>The removal of a bulky TV from a pensioner's home</li>
<li>Carnivals with fancy dress parades</li>
<li>Kite flying on a popular tourist beach in east Yorkshire</li>
<li>Stopping pupils from going on playground monkey bars</li>
<li>Using pins to secure commemorative poppies</li>
<li>School football games without a sponge ball</li>
<li>Children banned from the sack race on sports day</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm a bit disappointed this is only 10 items long.  I've heard loads of way sillier "health and safety" excuses in my time in the UK.  I think this list should be extended to 100 and each council and company involved named and shamed for their shameless excuses.</p>
<p>Bring on the health and safety review and let common sense prevail.</p>
