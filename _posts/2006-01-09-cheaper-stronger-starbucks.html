<p>Did you know that Starbucks has another size that they don't advertise but is available on request? It's the "<a href="https://www.slate.com/id/2133754/?nav=ais">short</a>". So next time you're in Starbucks, ask for a short cappuccino and you'll get a smaller, stronger and better coffee for less, and it will be a proper cappuccino - remember, too much milk in a cappuccino makes it a latte.  I'll have to test this myself to see if it's true for the UK too.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> You can ask for this in the UK too. Claire asked for a short latte and got one without any question, and saved 20p too.</p>
