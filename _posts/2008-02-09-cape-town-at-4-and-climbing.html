<p>Looks like everyone is taking heed of the South African blogs and voting for Cape Town. <a href="http://www.monopolyworldvote.com/en_ZA/world/leaders">Check it out</a>, up to 4th already.</p>
<p><img class="center" src="/assets/monopolyct4th.jpg" alt="Cape Town Now 4th" /></p>
<p>Keep up your <a href="http://www.monopolyworldvote.com/en_ZA/world">daily votes</a> and who knows, maybe Cape Town will come out tops. Oh, and don't forget to nominate "Johannesburg" for your wildcard choice. It's up to 9th now.</p>
