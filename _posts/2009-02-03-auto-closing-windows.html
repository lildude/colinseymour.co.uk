<p>In the process of attempting to find details on exactly what the <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/finally-a-use-for-the-w-button">"W" button</a> on my car does (the manual doesn't say), I stumbled upon this really cool and useful feature I wished <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/my-new-car-the-vw-golf-gt">my car</a> had, without realising it actually has it: auto-closing windows.  Well, almost auto-closing: I just need to press and hold the open or close button on the key remote and all the electric windows will either open or close. How cool, and lazy, is that!!??</p>
