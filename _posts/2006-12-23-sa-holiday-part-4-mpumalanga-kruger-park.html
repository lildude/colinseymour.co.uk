<p>Woohoo!!! I've finally finished going through all my pictures from our 3rd and final week on holiday in South Africa in September, and I have uploaded them for you <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/gallery/album/mpumalanga-september-2006/">all to see</a>.</p>
<p>We spent out third week staying just outside Hazyview in the Hazyview Cabanas.  Once again it was courtesy of mum's timeshare - thanks mum.</p>
<p>This was a very special week.  We got to relax, take in the scenes, the waterfalls, see loads of wildlife in the Kruger Park and of course <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/we-got-engaged">I proposed to Claire</a>.</p>
<p>Go check out the pics in my <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/gallery/">gallery</a>.  Just a word of warning, it can be a bit slow loading the pictures, but fear not, I'm working on improving the load times.</p>
