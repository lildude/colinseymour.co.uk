<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.henriska.com/blog/?p=615">Pigeon beats ADSL handsdown .. classic.</a> - What a brilliant way to kick Telkom (South Africa's largest telecoms company) into gear and make them catch a wake up about their high costs and bad service.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.news24.com/Content/SciTech/News/1132/1bc8b09e39b043928317dc769d4196e4/09-09-2009-12-23/Pigeon_beats_Telkom">Pigeon beats Telkom</a> - He did it. Winston proved that good old fashioned homing pigeons are way quicker to send data than Telkom's 1mbps ADSL.  Pity you can't surf the internet with a pigeon.</li>
<li><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8243553.stm">Makeover for SA gender-row runner</a> - See, told you she was a lady. Maybe she should have hit the track all tarted up to keep the IAAF happy.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vi2p-7qw-Q0">YouTube - Tannie Gogga - Pap en Vleis - Jacaranda 94.2FM</a> - Lady Gagga's Poker Face done South African styleeee.  Brilliant parody, if you understand afrikaans and the South African braai culture.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.southafrica.info/news/sport/rugby-150909.htm">Rugby opens up for Argentina</a> - Finally!!! Watchout Northern Hemisphere, you're in for some tough opposition from the Southerners come 2012.</li>
