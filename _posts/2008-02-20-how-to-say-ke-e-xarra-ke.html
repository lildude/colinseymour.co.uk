<p>The other day I pointed out this rather odd line of text in the new SA School's Pledge and didn't know how to pronounce it.  Well, now I do...</p>
<p>[audio:https://colinseymour.co.uk/downloads/xarra.mp3]</p>
<p>It's Khoisan, and as <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/blog/new-sa-schools-pledge/#comment-6993">Claire pointed</a> out it means ‘Diverse People Unite’, or ‘Unity in Diversity’.</p>
<p>It's actually the motto on the new South African Coat of Arms too (you find the significance of all the elements <a href="https://www.info.gov.za/aboutgovt/symbols/coa/index.htm">here</a>):</p>
