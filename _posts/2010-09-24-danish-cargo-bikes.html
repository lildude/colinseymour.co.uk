<p>How's this for a great modification to the humble bicycle to extend its use?</p>

<p>I've seen, and quite like the idea of, bicycle trailers for towing your <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Adventure-Child-Alloy-Two-Seater-Trailer/dp/B001OC6CE6/colsey-21/" target="_blank">kids</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Raleigh-Utility-Trailer/dp/B000W4BCXI/colsey-21/" target="_blank">shopping</a> (you can <a href="https://www.waitrose.com/branches/branchdetails.aspx?uid=180" target="_blank">borrow one from Waitrose</a> if you don't have your own), but the Danes' cargo bikes take things to a whole new level.  </p>
<p>Not sure I'll be trading in the car just yet though.</p>
