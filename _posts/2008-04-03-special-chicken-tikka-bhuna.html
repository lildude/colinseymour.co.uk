<p>We're off for a team curry at the <a href="http://www.ancientraj.co.uk/">Ancient Raj</a> in Frimley this evening and I thought I'd peruse the menu before we go (we're hoping may speed things up if we can pre-order before arriving).</p>
<p>In my perusals I encountered the usual assortment of well known Indian dishes, and then I encountered <a href="http://www.ancientraj.co.uk/acatalog/chefs_recommendations_Indian_Menu.html#a160">this</a> intriguing dish:</p>

<p>It's so special that the chicken isn't really chicken. Now that's special.</p>
