<p>How's this for a crazy way of raising money for charity.  My cousin, Heather, and a couple of her friends are raising money for a charity called Starfish in aid of children orphaned by HIV/AIDS in South Africa.  They are doing this, as the title says, by cycling from Trafalgar Square in London, all the way through Africa to Table Mountain in Cape Town.</p>
<p>Check out their <a href="http://www.trafalgarsquaretotablemountain.co.uk">progress</a> and photo's and if you're feeling generous, give the kids in SA a little helping <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/tsttm1">hand</a>.</p>
