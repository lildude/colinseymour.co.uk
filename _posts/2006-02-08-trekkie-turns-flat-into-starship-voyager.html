<p>Some really sad Trekkie has spent just over Â£12 000 and converted the inside of his flat to look like the <a href="http://www.24thcid.com/24th_century_design.swf">inside of the Starship Voyager spaceship from Star Trek</a>.  In the process he managed to get himself declared bankrupt too. I must be one of the only few techies who doesn't like Star Trek/Wars.</p>
