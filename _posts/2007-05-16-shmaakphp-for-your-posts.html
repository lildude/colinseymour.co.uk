<p><a href="http://www.amatomu.com"><img class="alignleft" src="https://www.amatomu.com/images/badges/badge_i_heart_black.png" alt="I shmaak SA Blogs, sorted with Amatomu.com" width="150" height="57" border="0" /></a>Not too long ago I registered my two blogs with <a href="//www.amatomu.com/">Amatomu</a> - a South African blog portal run by the <a href="http://www.mg.co.za">Mail &amp; Guardian</a> newspaper, that attempts to correlate and link to as many South African blogs as possible. If you've got an interest in what other SA blogs have to say, it's worth a peruse.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="http://eishcoza.blogspot.com">Eish!!</a> made a valid point <a href="http://eishcoza.blogspot.com/2007/05/helping-readers-schmaak-eish.html">today</a> - wouldn't it be great to have a "<acronym title="South African slang for 'really like'">Shmaak It</acronym>" link/button on the actual posts on your blog '<em>that would make it easy for the readers to click-and-schmaak?</em>'.  This would be similar to the way you can set up a '<em>Digg this</em>' button for <a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg</a></p>
<p>I had a quick look into this, and sorry folks - only bad news.  I don't think it's going to be possible at the moment for a couple of reasons:</p>
<p>1.  You can't predict reliably when your post has made it to Amatomu.  This would leave a period where your post is visible on your blog, but isn't known by Amatomu, so it can't be Shmaaked.<br />
2.  You can't predict what "rss_id" Amatomu will assign to the post when it does appear on Amatomu.  Guessing would only give someone else all your Shmaaks.<br />
3.  You need to be logged in to Amatomu in order to Shmaak a post.  This limits who can actually Shmaak a post.</p>
<p>Whilst all of this isn't impossible to <del datetime="2007-05-16T16:36:35+00:00">hack</del> code around, it would mean probing the Amatomu site a fair bit, which I doubt they'd like. I don't think your hosting company or bandwidth bills would like it either. It would also leave you with a period where your post is available via your site, but not on Amatomu - Amatomu won't process a Shmaak for a post it doesn't know about.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe M&amp;G will make a public API available for just this functionality.  Amatomu, just like every good Web 2.0 app is still in "Alpha".</p>
