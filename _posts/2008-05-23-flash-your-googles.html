<p>If you happen to be walking down the road and notice an average looking car approaching with some sort of strange looking device strapped to it's roof, much like <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2007/06/01/take-a-look-at-the-vehicle-thats-taking-a-look-at-you/">this one</a> or <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gadgets/eye-on-you/google-streetview-camera-car-fleet-set-to-invade-america-279222.php">one of these</a>, be sure to "Flash Your Googles" as this <a title="Flash Your Googles" href="//maps.google.com/maps?f=q&geocode=&layer=c&ie=UTF8&cbll=41.547412,-87.642495&panoid=6WQU2RGVaPYdF6ai7m-Jpw&cbp=1,345.89688889785936,,2,13.222784903473748&ll=41.551001,-87.641673&spn=0.007146,0.014591&z=16">enterprising lass in Illinois</a> did.</p>
<p>Please get your timing right though - there's no point having Google obtaining "Streetview" shots if they're missing out on the best bits ;-)</p>
