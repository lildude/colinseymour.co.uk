Looky looky ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘“ folks, a nice new design for my site, and it should be much faster too ðŸ’¨ with âœ¨ emoji too.  

It's been a while since I last posted but I've been busy working behind the scenes on moving all my sites away from a dynamic method of generating them to a more robust, future-proof and fast method: static pages using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  This is like we used to do it in the old days before databases became popular on website but now with a whole bunch of tooling around it to make it easier.

Now things are looking sweet and fast, I hope to get back into the habit of posting more frequently.  I'll also be slowly iterating on the design and fixing a few things as I go along.
