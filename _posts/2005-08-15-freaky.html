<p>In an effort to find some South African blogs, I stumbled upon a very good one - <a href="http://www.joblog.co.za">Jo'blog</a>. Well, I've got a lot of catching up to do as these guys blog like it's going out of fashion.  This morning, I was trawling through their archives and stumbled upon <a href="http://www.joblog.co.za/2005/06/one_fine_day_at.html">One Find Day at the Office...</a>.  This has a Google Map of where these guys are located.  It freaked me out - it's EXACTLY the same pic I grabbed for my <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/mums-house-on-google-maps">Mum's House on Google Maps</a> post.  A little more research reveals these guys' <a href="http://www.missinglink.co.za/" alt="MissingLink.co.za">company</a> is actually located in the Banbury Cross Village - just stumbling distance from my old front door. </p>
<p>How's that for a small world?</p>
