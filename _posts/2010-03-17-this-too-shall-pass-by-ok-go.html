<p>How's this for a music video... </p>
<div class="center"><object width="480" height="295" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/qybUFnY7Y8w&rel=0&hl=en_GB&fs=1"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/qybUFnY7Y8w&rel=0&hl=en_GB&fs=1" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><!--[if IE]><embed src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/qybUFnY7Y8w&rel=0&hl=en_GB&fs=1"type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="480" height="295"><![endif]--><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qybUFnY7Y8w"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/qybUFnY7Y8w/hqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube Video" title="Watch the video on YouTube" /></a></object></div>
<p>The requirements for the video were...</p>
<blockquote><p>... that it had to be interesting, not "overbuilt" or too technology-heavy, and easy to follow.  The machine also had to be built on a shoestring budget, synchronize with beats and lyrics in the music and end on time over a 3.5 minute song, play a part of the song, and be filmed in one shot.  To make things more challenging still, the space chosen was divided into two floors and the machine would use both.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think they met the stipulated requirements.</p>
