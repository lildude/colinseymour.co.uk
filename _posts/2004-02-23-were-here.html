<p>Well, everything on the house has all gone through and we are now moved in. We're living out of boxes, but that shouldn't be for too long as we plan on doing a bit of furniture shopping in the next few weeks. (Pay day this week :-) ) Also planning on buying a nice big digital telly with DVD player and surround sound speakers with my bonus.</p>
<p>If you know me, details of my new house are traversing along the wires of the Internet right now.</p>
<p>Drop me a line, or send me a card.</p>
