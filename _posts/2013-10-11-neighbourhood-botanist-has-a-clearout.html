<p>Not content with just mentioning the <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/neighbourhood-cannabis-farm-shutdown">raid on our local cannabis farm</a>, I thought I'd dig out my pap lens and snap a picture of all his paraphanalia being laid out ready to be carted off...</p>

<p>All that greenery to the left of the pile of junk is NOT a hedge :-) I think he was quite a botanist; just too good for our local constabulary to be comfortable with :-)</p>
