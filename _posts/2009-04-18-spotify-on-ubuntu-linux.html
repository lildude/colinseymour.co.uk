<p>I'm working this weekend.  Normally when I work a weekend shift, I bring in my laptop, head on over to <a href="http://www.last.fm">last.fm</a> and start listening.  Not this weekend.</p>
<p>I was so impressed with <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/spotify-all-the-music-you-can-stream-for-free">Spotify last weekend</a> that I've followed the simple <a href="http://www.spotify.com/en/help/faq/wine/">Spotify under Wine</a> instructions to see if I could get it working on Linux and what do you know, it works a treat...</p>

<p>It's a little jaggered around the edges, but I put that down to the age of my laptop.  The actual performance and sound quality is spot on and it works a treat.  So once again, my laptop will be acting as a glorified music player for the entire weekend.</p>
