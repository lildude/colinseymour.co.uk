This is a company that seems to emphasize the "cheerful" part of the old adage: "cheap and cheerful" .</p>
<p>At the time of our flight, Kulula were going for superheroes in a big way: to Kulula, ALL of their passengers are superheroes.  At the time all their advertising was pushing this and even the flights we were on had a little "dooo da dooo" announced over the speaker system on take off (just superheroes always do when they take off ;-) ).</p>
<p>Well, it looks like Kulula have another brilliant idea: Flying 101.  Check out the new paint job:</p>

<p>So now you know exactly what goes where and what all those little things were for. </p>
