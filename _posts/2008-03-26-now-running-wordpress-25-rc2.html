<p><a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk">colinseymour.co.uk</a> is now running on <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-rc2/">Wordpress 2.5 RC2</a>.  Hopefully this will iron out some of the niggles I encountered with RC1.  If you're tempted to upgrade, check out the <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-rc2/">screencast</a> showing some of the cool new features.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Upgraded to the official <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-brecker/">Wordpress 2.5</a> release now.</p>
