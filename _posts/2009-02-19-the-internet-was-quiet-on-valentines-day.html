<p>The internet must has been a quiet place on Valentine's day.  Either that or I just don't have enough romantic stuff on my site.  </p>
<p>I was perusing my visitor stats this evening (I don't really get that many visitors, but it's nice to see what I do get) and noticed this strange drop in traffic on 14 February:</p>

<p>In a way it's disappointing, but on the other hand I'm glad people actually took the time out from the Internet and spent it with their other halves instead of spending the whole day surfing the net and stumbling upon the crap I dish out ;-) .</p>
<p>That said, my <a href="http://www.lildude.co.uk">techie site</a> didn't see any change from it's usually low weekend visitors (most people visit during the week).  I guess that kind of proves that most hardcore techies don't have 3D other halves to keep them entertained ;-) .</p>
