<p>Oh my word, the South Africans have just been given a complete pasting by England in the 2nd One Day International at Trent Bridge.  SA were all out for 83 in 23 overs and England replied with 85 for 0 in 14.1 overs. I don't think I want to watch the highlights tonight; it'll just be embarrassing.</p>
