<p>In a word <acronym title="ouch">EINA</acronym>!!. A controversial new <a href="https://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?from=rss_South%20Africa&set_id=1&click_id=13&art_id=vn20070320035205580C312983">anti-rape device</a> may be hitting the SA shelves soon. It's a such shame women have to go to such extreme levels in order to protect themselves, but when the level of rape in SA is so high, what other choice do they have?  This device will certainly make rapists think twice, it's just a pity it means women have to too.</p>
