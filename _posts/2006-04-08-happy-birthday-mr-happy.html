The Mr Men stories are 35 years old this year.  The BBC has an amusing "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/default.stm">pointless poll</a>"... </p>
<p>What new character would you like to see introduced?</p>
<ul>
<li>Mr Asbo</li>
<li>Little Miss Teenage Mum</li>
<li>Mr Binge Drinker</li>
</ul>
<p>How appropriate for Britain today.</p>
