<p>Interesting links for 20 April 2007 - 21 April 2007:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6570907.stm">Blood 'may provide new HIV drug'</a> - Now this would be brilliant.  They always said the cure for HIV/AIDS would come from Africa, but who'd have thought it may actually come from within us.</li>
<li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6575345.stm">Iconic Banksy Image Painted Over</a> - Hmmm, one less tourist attraction thanks to TfL</li>
<li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,2061288,00.html?gusrc=rss&feed=1">Crocs Banned in Swedish Hospital</a> - These should be banned from everywhere.  These are the most hideous shoes I have ever seen.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thewvsr.com/adsvsreality.htm">Fast Food: Ads vs. Reality</a> - This is one of the things that winds me up - why can't my food look like the pics in the adverts?  Isn't this a form of false representation, or misleading advertising?</li>
<li><a href="http://whoissick.org/sickness/">Who is Sick?</a> - Hypochondriacs unite. A whole website devoted to people bragging about their illnesses. Oooo, my tummy hurts, I know, I'll post it on the internet.</li>
</ul>
