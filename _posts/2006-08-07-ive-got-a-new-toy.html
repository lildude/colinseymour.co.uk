<p>In preparation for our upcoming holiday, and out of the sheer desire to take better photos, I splashed out on one of these this weekend:</p>
<p><img class="centered" src="/img/NikonD50.jpg" alt="Nikon D50" /></p>
<p>It's a Nikon D50 Digital SLR.  It's an entry level DSLR camera, which makes it perfect for my needs.  I've had a little tinker with it and I'm very impressed. With a bit of time and loads of practise, I'll be like David Bailey or some other well known photographer.  All I've got to do now is take some pictures :-)</p>
