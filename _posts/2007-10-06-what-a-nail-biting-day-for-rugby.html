<p>What a day for rugby.  If I didn't have so much biltong and so many jelly beans to munch through, I'd have gnawed my nails to the bone.</p>
<p>First England pipped Australia and then France were their characteristic selves and pulled one out of the hat again by sneaking past New Zealand. Both games were won by a mere 2 points too.</p>
<p>Who'd have thunk it?  Both England and France started their world campaigns quite badly and now they're through to the semi-finals (against each other) and both Australia and New Zealand, the favourites, are OUT!</p>
<p>Holding thumbs we don't have 2 shockers tomorrow.  I really don't want to see the other semi being Scotland vs Fiji.  Hopefully the Boks will at least win their game.</p>
