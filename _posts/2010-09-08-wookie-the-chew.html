<p>Winnie the Pooh as you've never seen it.  Or should that be Star Wars as you've never seen it...</p>

<p>I've just discovered these lovely images by <a href="https://jameshance.com/" target="_blank">James Hance</a>, that you can have as <a href="https://jameshance.com/cartoons.html" target="_blank">prints</a> or printed on <a href="https://jameshance.com/t-shirts.html" target="_blank">t-shirts</a>, in which he depicts Han Solo as Christopher Robin, Chewbacca as Pooh Bear, R2D2 as Piglet, and an AT-AT as Eeyore.</p>
<p>I think these are very cute and very well done.  A perfect gift for the Star Wars fan who's now a parent, or maybe the Winnie the Pooh fan who's now become a Star Wars fan.</p>
<p>Head on over to <a href="https://jameshance.com/" target="_blank">James's site</a> and have a look at some of his other artwork.  If you're a Muppet fan, you won't be disappointed.</p>
