<p>Yes folks, you can now get <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/99763771/placebo-max-strength" target="_blank">Placebo Max Strength</a> for a meagre £5.99+pp to deal with all your aches and pains.</p>
<p>Now before you poo-poo the idea as an expensive (16 aspirin cost less than £1) joke, read these two articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/12/22/evidence-that-placebos-could-work-even-if-you-tell-people-they%E2%80%99re-taking-placebos/" target="_blank">Evidence that placebos work even if you tell people they're taking placebos</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/neurotribes/2010/12/22/meet-the-ethical-placebo-a-story-that-heals/" target="_blank">Meet the ethical placebo</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm jealous that I didn't think of this first.  If this chap can sell these to the NHS and become the sole supplier, he'll be rich beyond his wildest dreams in no time :-)</p>
