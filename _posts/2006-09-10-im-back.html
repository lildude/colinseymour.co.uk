<p>After a very enjoyable 3 weeks in South Africa, I'm all relaxed, refreshed and back in the UK.  I've got about a million emails and blogs to read, and about 900 photos to sift through from my trip, but I should be back up and running again as normal in a couple of days. I've also got a shed load of posts in mind, so watch this space.</p>
