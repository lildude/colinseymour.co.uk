<p>It snowed last night - <strong>YAY!</strong><br />
I've got to work today - <strong>BOO!</strong><br />
I'm on the early shift, so get to leave early to go play in the snow - <strong>YAY!</strong><br />
It'll probably have melted by then - <strong>BOO!</strong><br />
Apparently we're going to get more - <strong>YAY!</strong></p>
<p>I do love it when it snows.  Coming from Africa, snow is still a bit of a novelty when it happens and I think everything looks so pretty with a fine dusting of snow.  Hopefully it won't be too dark when I get home this afternoon so I can go get some nice pictures.</p>
<div class="update">
<strong>Update</strong>: All the snow disappeared before I could come out to play - <strong>BOO!</strong>
