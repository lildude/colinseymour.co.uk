<p>Did you know that if you hold a chicken and move it around, it'll keep its head in the same place, as if it is bolted to the spot?  Don't believe me? Check this video out:</p>
<div class="center"><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/_dPlkFPowCc&rel=0&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999&hl=en&feature=player_embedded&fs=1" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/_dPlkFPowCc&rel=0&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999&hl=en&feature=player_embedded&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></div>
