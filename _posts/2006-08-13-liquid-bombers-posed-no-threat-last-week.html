<p>All the fuss last week was over something that <a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14320452/">wasn't even a threat</a> - it was caused by Uncle Sam getting a bit tetchy.  Mr Reid, please lower the security level tomorrow (I know you're enjoying your Sunday roast right now) so things are back to normal by Saturday.</p>
