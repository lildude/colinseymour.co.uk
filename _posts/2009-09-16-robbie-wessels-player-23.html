<p>If you're South African, you'll probably recognise and be able to understand this song.  If you're not, you'll still get the gist of it (there isn't that much afrikaans in it).  I think it's a true indication of South Africa's dedication to rugby and definitely a great laugh.  Oh and watch out for the drive-by-peeing, they're far deadlier than a drive-by-shooting ;-) . </p>

<p>And yes, we do take the <acronym title="BBQ">braai</acronym> to the rugby, doesn't everyone?</p>
