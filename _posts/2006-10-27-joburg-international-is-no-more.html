<p>Don't worry, it's still there, but as of today, it's just called the <a href="http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=124&art_id=qw1161931501267B255">OR Tambo International Airport</a>. </p>
<p>Bloody waste of money if you ask me... South Africa is still a third world country with thousands of people living in poverty, yet members of the government seem to be dead keen on wasting millions of Rands changing the names of places and to contravene their own policy (in this case renaming an airport after a polititian).  </p>
<p>I can understand the desire to remove any association with apartheid, or returning places to their original names, but changing the names of places just for the sake of it is taking the piss. </p>
<p>Jo'burg International was changed to that name at great cost to remove it's association with apartheid (Jan Smuts), so why change it again?</p>
