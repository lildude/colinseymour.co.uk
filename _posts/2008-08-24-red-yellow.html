<p>I've been working through the mountains of photos I took in the 10 days Mum and Sam were over and stumbled upon this one I took at the Eden Project.  I literally just cropped it and increased the blacks and this is the result: an accidental "Photo of the Week".</p>
<p>I think I need to start making an active effort to take photos of other things as this is now my 6th flower picture in my "Photo of the Week" series.</p>
