<p>Interesting links for 19 Feb 08 - 28 Feb 08:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.c0t0d0s0.org/archives/4149-Solaris-Features-Service-Management-Facility.html">Solaris Features: Service Management Facility</a> - A great introductory tutorial on Solaris 10's &quot;Service Management Facility&quot; (SMF).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/banking/ped/">PIN Entry Device (PED) vulnerabilities</a> - So Chip And PIN is not quite a secure as the banks would have you believe, and something as simple as not trying to save a quick buck could have prevented this whole issue.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=1257">Cold Boot Attacks on Disk Encryption</a> - An interesting way to take advantage of a limitation of today's DRAM memory to grab things like encryption keys before they're lost from DRAM, even after powering off the machine.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.heise-online.co.uk/security/Enclosed-but-not-encrypted--/features/110136/0">Enclosed, but not encrypted</a> - When 128-bit AES encryption isn't anything more than an XOR.  A great explanation into the flawed and supposed 128-bit AES encryption offered by one disk manufacturer.</li>
<li><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7250068.stm">Toshiba climbs on 'HD DVD exit'</a> - Well, I'm glad I sat back and watched this happen rather than spending my pennies.  What is good, IMHO, is that the better technology has prevailed, unlike the old VHS - Betamax battle</li>
</ul>
