<p>Tonight I was flipping through the channels on our Sky box (I don't subscribe, I just see what I can get for free) and stumbled upon "Urban TV" showing a dreadful South African <em>drama</em> - "Jozi - H".  It's apparently a medical drama set in "Johannesburg's trauma unit" in a kind of ER style.  One question: Which one?  Jo'burg has many, and I certainly don't recognise this one.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I can't say I've ever heard of a TV program in SA called "Jozi - H" (the first SA program made purely for a foreign market?), but one thing is for sure, it's strange to see a TV program where the American accent is put on, and not the South African.</p>
