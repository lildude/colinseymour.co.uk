<blockquote cite="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jan/10/antioxidant-myth-easy-to-swallow">In reality, Professor James Watson – one of the DNA double-helix's founding fathers – was only restating what we at Cancer Research UK (along with many others) have been pointing out for years. Large studies have repeatedly shown that, with the possible exception of vitamin D, antioxidant supplements have negligible positive effect on healthy people, at least in terms of important things such as preventing people getting cancer or dying prematurely. And some supplements – notably vitamins A, E and beta-carotene – even seem to slightly raise the risk of disease and early death.<br />

<p>So folks, start eating a varied diet, LCHF of course ;-),  and just eat tasty food because it's tasty. Then throw away your vitamin supplements and start saving today.</p>
