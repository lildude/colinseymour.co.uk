<p>When you log a support call with Sun, the first person you'll speak to is not technical at all, and to be honest, generally not the brightest pea in the pod.  As a result, we get some absolute beauties for problem descriptions which the non-technical person has obtained from the phone conversation.</p>
<p>This one just came in that amused my entire team:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/terrorbite.png" alt="The most dangerous type of filesystem" title="Terror Bite" width="338" height="42" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993 center" /></p>
<p>That's one very dangerous filesystem, but there's no need to contact the RSPCA as it's limited to only 1 terror bite anyway.</p>
