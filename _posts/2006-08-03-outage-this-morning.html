<p>Well, as you can see we're now up and running again.  The problem started at a little before 9am this morning and everything came back to life at 12:46 to be precise. The worst thing of all... my hosting company advertises 24/7 support, yet it took them about 4 hours to resolve the issue (I suspect only after I bitched on their forums) and they have still not responded to my service ticket.</p>
