<p>I don't believe it. I've just read that <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7626646.stm">Thabo Mbeki, South Africa's president is going to step down</a> after being asked to by the ANC's National Executive Committee. Apparently this is "an effort to heal and unite the ANC", the county's ruling party.  </p>
<p>Whilst I agree South Africa hasn't seen the changes at the rate everyone wanted or expected, I can't help but feel this is unnecessary grandstanding by the party, especially as Thabo Mbeki has less than a year left in office anyway.  The general election will still take place next year, so what difference can be made in the mean time?</p>
<p>I'm sure we'll hear more about this over the coming weeks. I only hope the neigh-sayers are wrong.  I really don't want to see South Africa going the way of other prosperous African countries.  I hope for everyone's sake Jacob Zuma proves the world wrong and proves he is a good leader.</p>
