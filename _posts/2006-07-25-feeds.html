<p>Welcome to my page of unofficial feeds that I've created.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan on syndication and RSS/ATOM feeds.  I use Google Reader to read all my feeds instead of actually visiting all the blogs, comics and news sites I read.  Yes, I'm very lazy.</p>
<p>I'm so lazy that if a site doesn't actually have a feed, I either don't read it anymore, or if it's of particular interest, I create my own unofficial feed. This page lists all the feeds I've created and automagically update every day. Thus far I've created feeds for the following sites:</p>
<h3>Comics</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.madamandeve.co.za">Madam & Eve</a> : <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/MadamEve"><img style="vertical-align:bottom; border:0" src="/img/feed-icon-12x12.gif" alt="RSS Icon" title="Unofficial Feed for Daily Madam & Eve Cartoons" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.mg.co.za/zapiro/">Zapiro</a> : <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/UnofficialZapiro"><img style="vertical-align:bottom; border:0" src="/img/feed-icon-12x12.gif" alt="RSS Icon" title="Unofficial Feed for Daily Zapiro Cartoons" /></a></p>
<p>These aren't dynamically created, but actually by a script that runs at a set interval, that scrapes the web pages and pulls the info I want.  This is then written to file (DB backend coming soon) and then the RSS feed is created.</p>
<p>All feeds I create are valid, where it's in my control, and use RSS 2.0 format.</p>
<p>Feel free to subscribe to any of these in your favourite aggregator. </p>
<div class="alert"><b>WARNING:</b> These are unofficial feeds and accordingly, I take no responsibility for their content.  If I have to remove a feed, I will update the feed to indicate it's removal, but I'm hoping I'll never have to do this.</div>
