<p>Just got an email from CAMRA with some great news...</p>

<p>Wooohooo!!! George Osborne has listened to the people and dropped the terrible idea that was the <a href="http://saveyourpint.co.uk/its-time-to-save-your-pint/what-is-the-escalator/" target="_blank">beer duty escalator</a>. For those who don't know, this was an annual "inflation +2%" rise in beer duty the previous government came up with.  Since then the price of beer has gone up and so have the number of pub closures.</p>
<p>What's more, George Osborne also announced he'll cut the duty on beer by 1p a pint. </p>
<p>Thanks George, my next pint will taste ever-so-slightly better though it would have been much nicer if you'd cut the duty by a lot more - over a third of my pint is still tax and that's not very nice.</p>
