<p>I've just had breakfast in an all America old fashioned diner.  It wasn't too bad either.  I've just got one question... </p>
<p><em>What's the obsession with fatty fried potatoes for breakfast?  </em></p>
<p>Yesterday I had a choice of 3 different types of fried potatoes, or I could swap it for fruit salad (which I did). Then today at a completely different diner I got offered 2 different types of fried potatoes.  I don't want greasy potato for breakfast with my bacon and eggs - just bacon, eggs, and some toast.  A bit of tomato or mushrooms wouldn't go a miss either, but I certainly don't want chips - yes, one of the options was chips.</p>
<p>One other thing, why can't they have easy names for how you'd like your eggs cooked?</p>
