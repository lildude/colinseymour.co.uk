<p><img class="alignleft" src="/img/spurslogo.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Spurs Logo" />I received an interesting link from Alan today regarding <a href="http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/">Tottenham Hotspur</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/charity-news/tottenham-sos-partnership-270307.htm">Tottenham Hotspur teams up with SOS Children in South Africa</a> - Tottenham have come up with an innovative way of supporting the SOS Children's charity in South Africa: they're using the money received from players' fines to support the running costs of the â€˜Spursâ€™ family home in the new SOS Childrenâ€™s Village in Rustenburg, South Africa.  The money will also be used to support a variety of community development projects in and around Rustenburg.</p>

<img class="alignright" src="/img/rustenburg.png" alt="Rustenburg on the Map" />Nice one lads.  I'm sure the players will continue to deliberately swear at the ref, or take someone out, once in a while just to ensure the charity doesn't lose out ;-) By any chance, was Rustenburg chosen for it's close proximity to <a href="http://http://www.suninternational.com/resorts/suncity/">Sun City</a> and the <a href="http://www.tourismnorthwest.co.za/pilanesberg/index.html">Pilanesburg Nature Reserve</a>?</p>
<p>As can be expected, they're also doing their bit for the local community by setting up the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation and donating Â£4.5 million to the foundation for improving the local community - and they're getting some <a href="http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/foundation/news/tottenhamhotspurfoundationreceivesstrongpoliticalbacking.html">good political backing</a> for it too.</p>
<p>Whilst I'm not a big football fan (maybe I should become one), I've not heard about any of the other clubs making such large contributions to charity and their local community, except Liverpool - all that equipment that will be knicked from the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/6517517.stm">building site of the new stadium</a> will certainly help a few enterprising Scousers in the local community :-) .</p>
