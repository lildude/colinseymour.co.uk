<p>A while back I <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/al-ppi-hard-sell">mentioned</a> I ordered a new car, well it arrived yesterday and I was like a child on Christmas morning, except without all the sweeties and wrapping paper.</p>
<p>As you may know, I'm a bit of a fan of Volkswagen, and chose to stick with VW for this car. I've always liked the GTi ever since I had one as a company car, however it's expensive, not the most economical car in the world, and insuring it would be a nightmare.  So instead I've gone for the <a href="http://www.vw.co.uk/new_cars/golf/gtsport">Golf GT TSI 170PS</a>. </p>
<p>The GT quenches my desire for a fast and nippy car that doesn't break the bank, and manages to keep costs down as it's very economical too, thanks to it's 1.4 litre engine.</p>
<p><!--more-->I know, I know... you're probably thinking "<em>1.4 litres!!!??? My lawnmower has got a bigger engine than that</em>", and I thought that too until I test drove the GT.  Boy is this baby quick. </p>
<p>Some quick facts to help put this into perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Max Power Output</strong>: 168 bhp / 170 PS</li>
<li><strong>Top Speed</strong>: 136mph / 220km/h</li>
<li><strong>0 - 62mph/100km/h</strong>: 7.9 sec</li>
<li><strong>Economy</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Urban</strong>: 28.5mpg - 9.9l/100km</li>
<li><strong>Extra-urban</strong>: 48.7mpg - 5.8l/100km</li>
<li><strong>Combined</strong>: 38.7mpg - 7.3l/100km</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's quicker than the Mark IV Golf GTi and more economical than 1.6 Golf I've just passed onto Claire. Pretty impressive for a 1.4 litre engine.

<p>Now for some piccies...</p>

<p>I'll think I'll hold off on <a href="http://www.topgear.com/content/features/stories/2007/04/stories/20/1.html">bumping it up to 230 Bhp</a> for the moment (thanks Alan).</p>
