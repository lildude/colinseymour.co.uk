<p>Merry Christmas everyone.  Have a super day and whilst you're pigging out on turkey and other goodies, listening to the Band Aid song "<em>Do they Know it's Christmas?</em>" - remember that it's not snowing anywhere in Africa today <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/do-they-know-its-christmas">*</a>, but there are still hungry peeps, so spare a thought for them.</p>
