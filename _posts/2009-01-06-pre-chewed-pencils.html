<p><img src="/img/pre-chewedpencils.jpg" alt="Pre-chewed Pencils" title="Pre-chewed Pencils" width="435px" height="200px" class="alignright" />Ahhhh, I missed out on a huge money making business when I was in high school... selling <a href="http://www.concentrate.org.uk/catalog/product_info.php?manufacturers_id=10&products_id=48">pre-chewed pencils</a> like the chappies over at <a href="http://www.concentrate.org.uk">Concentrate</a>.  I used to gnaw my way through pens and pencils like there was no tomorrow.  I'm disappointed I missed out on making some money from such a "healthy" habit.</p>
