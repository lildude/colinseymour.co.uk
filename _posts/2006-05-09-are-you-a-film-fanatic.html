<p>Consider yourself a bit of a film fanatic? Well try your luck at this.  <a href="http://www.lovefilm.com/">LOVEFiLM.com</a> have released this picture cryptically depicting 100 film titles.  This is very much like the Virgin Digital "Exercise Your Mind" puzzle I posted <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/exercise-your-music-muscle">last year</a>.</p>
<p>LOVEFiLM.com do state on the <a href="http://www.lovefilm.com/desktop.php">wallpaper page</a> that they will release the answers in the next few weeks, unlike Virgin Digital who've yet to publish the official results, but until then, happy hunting.</p>
