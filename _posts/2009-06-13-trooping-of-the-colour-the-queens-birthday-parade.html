<p>Guess who got to go see the Trooping of the Colour: The Queen's Birthday Parade today.  I'll give you a hint, they're circled in the picture above (click it for a better look) and managed to get a good 20 seconds worth of TV time too.  </p>
<p>It's my mum-and-dad in-law, Ian and Judith :-) .  </p>
<p>If you're in the UK, you can spot them at 1:38 in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00l7689/Trooping_the_Colour_The_Queens_Birthday_Parade/">iPlayer footage</a>.  There may be other occasions, but this is the one we spotted.</p>
