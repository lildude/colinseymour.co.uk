<p><img class="alignleft" src="/assets/sarugby.jpg" alt="SA Rugby" />South Africa were sooo close to winning today's game. </p>
<p>I'm working, so I had to resort to using the rather biased Five Live commentary to listen to the game. From what I heard, it seems all these boyjies need is a bit more experience, improved fitness and the 13 okes <del datetime="2006-11-18T16:31:17+00:00">sitting on their arses</del> resting at home in sunny SA and they'll be kicking some ass.  Talking of kicking... it sounds like Francois Steyn has quite a boot on him, and he's only 19 (Five Live kept going on about this).  Could he be the next <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naas_Botha">Naas</a>? Could we see him taking penalties from well within his own half?  He certainly seems happy to have a go at the odd drop-goal or two. Only time will tell how good he turns out - that same time that will tell is Jake White keeps his job.</p>

<p>In true South African fashion, only one year out from the world cup, <a href="http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=6&click_id=194&art_id=vn20061118125110506C843872">people are are calling for him to be axed</a> without actually thinking about what he's doing.  He's following the wishes of the SA Rugby board - he's trying out new talent.  He's experimenting in order to add more depth to the SA team.  Give him the time and let him prove himself with a full complement of players and a stack of new talent and if he cocks it up, then give him the boot, by all means. </p>
<p>He's either got to be getting something right if a young, inexperienced, experimental team managed to only lose by 2 points to the current world champs, or England are really that bad at the moment ;-). </p>
