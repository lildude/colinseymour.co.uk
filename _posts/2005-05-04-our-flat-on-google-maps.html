<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> have introduced quite a cool feature called Google Maps (<a href="http://maps.google.com">US</a> / <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk">UK</a>).  You can basically enter an address, postcode or a whole bunch of other things and you'll get a map of the location.  You can then get Google to give you directions etc.  At the moment this only covers the UK and the US with the US having more features at the moment.  However, I've found a site that lets you put a picture from your flickr collection into the description for an address based in it's geographical co-ordinates.</p>
<p>What's cool with the US one is you can get good satellite images for places like <a href="//maps.google.com/maps?q=disneyworld&ll=28.402576,-81.578486&sll=28.538056,-81.379444&spn=0.008261,0.010879&sspn=0.132179,0.174065&t=k&hl=en">Disneyworld</a>, <a href="//maps.google.com/maps?q=Hollywood+Sign&sll=34.132719,-118.321638&spn=0.007939,0.007607&sspn=0.063515,0.060854&t=k&hl=en">The Hollywood sign</a> and even <a href="//maps.google.com/maps?q=groom+lake,nv&ll=37.272835,-115.798731&sll=36.518555,-115.561924&spn=0.060081,0.085402&sspn=0.127029,0.120678&t=k&hl=en">Area 51</a>.  Cool!!!</p>
