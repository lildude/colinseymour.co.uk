<p>This weekend was the August bank holiday in the UK. This weekend traditionally hosts the <a href="http://www.readingfestival.com/" target="_blank">Reading</a> and <a href="http://www.leedsfestival.com/" target="_blank">Leeds</a> festivals and as with all festivals there are a lot of people, beer, loud music (we can hear it from our flat over 5km away at times) and rubbish.  How much rubbish?  They say a picture is worth a thousand words, so how's this for an explanation...</p>

<p>This is the Reading Festival site, alongside which I regularly run, <strong><em>AFTER</em></strong> everyone has gone home!!  </p>
<p>Yes folks, that is the rubbish, tents, sleeping bags, cloths, half-eaten food and who knows what else left behind because it's simpler and cheaper to do so than taking it home.  This is also quite a nice picture to show you just how big the Reading Festival is these days, and to think it's within easy walking distance of a big town; not in the middle of nowhere like Glastonbury.</p>
<p>You can see more pictures of the sea of rubbish on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/23862979" target="_blank">Beeb</a> and that <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2403467/Reading-Festival-2013--fetch-dustpan-brush.html" target="_blank">other rag</a>, which I bet saw plenty copies of its publication lying around in the mess :-)</p>
