This chap here is Bill Moyer, 73.  He was <a href="http://www.canada.com/national/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=581719e6-4f85-48bb-a52c-615ef31355e7">spotted</a> sporting a "Bullshit Protector" flap over his ear while President George W. Bush addressed the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Idaho yesterday.</p>
<p>This old chap has managed to get himself written about all over the web, so much so, the peeps over at <a href="http://www.wiseass.org">WiseAss.org</a> felt inspired to put together a <a href="http://www.wiseass.org/bullshit.html">Do-It-Yourself kit</a> with varying designs.  </p>
<p>Pity their designs don't quite look the same as Bill's, never the less, print off a couple for your next board meeting :-)</p>
