<p>It's been a bit quiet round here as Claire and I have been away on our early summer holidays in France.  We got back yesterday and have spent the best part of today doing laundry, shopping and just chilling before work tomorrow.  I've uploaded loads of pics, I just not organised them yet.  I'll add a post some time this week with all the news and details of our holiday.</p>
