<p>So what happens when, despite very strict "Do NOT talk or text" rules, you decide to text in the <a href="https://drafthouse.com" target="_blank">Alamo Drafthouse</a> movie cinema in Austin, Texas and ignore the two warning you are given?  You get kicked out without a refund.  What happens when you then call up and leave a snotty ranting voicemail?  You become a movie star!!!</p>
<p>That's exactly what happened to a young "lady" and I use that word loosely, who's voicemail rant has become the content for the latest Alamo Drafthouse "Don't Talk or Text" PSA ...</p>

<p>You can watch the not-so-family-friendly version without the bleeps and random characters <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L3eeC2lJZs" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I love the way the CEO signs off his <a href="https://cf.drafthouse.com/she_texted_we_kicked_her_out2.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> about this...</p>
<blockquote><p>Ma'am, you may be free to text in all the other theaters in the Magnited States of America, but here at our "little crappy ass theater," you are not. Why you may ask? Well, we actually do give a f*$k.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well put and brilliant idea.</p>
