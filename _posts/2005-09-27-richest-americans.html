<p>Forbes have released their <a href="http://www.forbes.com/lists/2005/54/Rank_1.html">list</a> of the 400 richest Americans - I suspect a fair number of which are in the top 10 of the world.  Of course his Billiness (Bill Gates) is at the top of the list with a whopping fortune of $51 billion - yup, that's $51 000 000 000 (9 zeros) - he's worth more than a lot countries <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29">GDP</a>.  There are a couple of other familiar names in the list like Michael Dell (of Dell fame), Steve Balmer (Microsoft), Steve Jobs (Apple) and Larry Ellison (Oracle), but what is kind of reassuring is there is no Scott McNeally (my big big big boss) or Jonathan Schwartz (my big big boss).  At least they're not making packets of money whilst the company is struggling.</p>
<p>My puny mind can hardly fathom having a million dollars to spend, let alone multibillions like Bill.</p>
