<p>Videos like this one from our friend in Wales really shouldn't be necessary, but as long as people continue flout the the laws and continue playing with their phones whilst driving, there's always a need.</p>
<p>Warning: this is using worst-case-scenario shock tactics to drive home the message. If you're easily offended, you may not want to watch this.</p>
<div class="center"><object width="480" height="295"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/zG7cPOE8uQQ&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/zG7cPOE8uQQ&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="295"></embed></object></div>
<p>In summary, just <strong>DON'T</strong> even contemplate it.  It's really not that important or worth it.</p>
