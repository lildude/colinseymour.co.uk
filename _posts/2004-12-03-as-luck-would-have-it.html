<p>Well, I've finally finished rev 2.0 of this site's design, and I hit a hurdle... a huge hurdle... the site where I host doesn't offer a feature I've come to rely on heavily in the next release. As such, the update has been put on hold until such time as I can find a new host or work-around this limitation. It'll probably be the former though : - ) </p>
<p>In the meantime, you can see what it should look like, by heading on over to my development site. This is hosted on my own machine at home, so it may not be available all the time. Especially as one of my disks is about to expire, so I shutdown a bit more often now.</p>
