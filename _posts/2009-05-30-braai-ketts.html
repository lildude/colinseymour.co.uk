<p>Look what we bought from the garden centre down the road.</p>

<p>We bought two bags - not because I was trying to be patriotic or anything, but because they were the cheapest.  2 for the price of one.  </p>
<p>This officially makes today's braai more a braai than a BBQ.  We'll be braaiing lamb and coriander burgers and thick streaky pork rashers for lunch today.  Tomorrow we've got wors, BBQ pork shoulder steaks and springbok steaks for lunch :-p</p>
