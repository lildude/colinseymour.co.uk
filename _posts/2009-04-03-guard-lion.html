<p>Mum's getting a bit concerned about her safety in sunny South Africa, so she's got herself a new guard lion:</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="/assets/lion1.jpg" alt="Lion (1)" title="Lion (1)" width="480" height="360" /><br />
<img src="/assets/lion2.jpg" alt="Lion (2)" title="Lion (2)" width="480" height="360" /></div>
<p>Hee hee hee. Brilliant. Thanks Mum.</p>
<p><small>Mum actually sent an email entitled "Brakpan Lions" with these pics.  Her "lions" are still on order ;-) </small></p>
