<p>Christmas isn't Christmas without certain things, and one of those things is the old classic kids movie The Snowman.  The most well known part of the whole movie is when the boy and the snowman go "flying through the air" - sing along everyone... "We're walking in the air...". </p>
<p>Unfortunately it's not on TV this year, but fear not, Irn Bru's brilliant rendition is.  Sit back and enjoy...</p>

<p>YouTube is also kind enough to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjPBuqWasaA">host the original</a> for those seeking the original version or the flying scene.  You can even watch the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ponB8Hd_lG4">whole movie</a> if you want.</p>
