<p><img class="alignleft" src="/assets/nminthesnow.jpg" alt="â€œThe Venueâ€ in the Snow" title="â€œThe Venueâ€ in the Snow" />I'm happy to announce, <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/blog/we-got-engaged/">exactly one year after I proposed to Claire</a>, we have decided on a venue and set a date to get married.</p>
<p>We'll be getting married on 4 July 2008 at a gorgeous little venue in Hampshire. I don't want to give away too many details as it'll spoil the surprise for everyone coming. The picture on the left should give you an idea of the kind of place, it just won't be snowing on our wedding day, but given the crazy summer we've had this year, anything is possible.</p>
