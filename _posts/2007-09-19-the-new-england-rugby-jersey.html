Word is out that England have changed their rugby jersey AGAIN.  As is common practice in the Internet age, photos of the new kit have slipped onto the net before they've been officially announced.</p>
<p>I think this is a much more appropriate design.  The old O<span style="vertical-align: sub; font-size: 8px">2</span> was more befitting of the English football team.  The new O<span style="vertical-align: sub; font-size: 8px">36</span> is much more appropriate for the soon-to-be ex-rugby world cup champs. ;-)</p>
