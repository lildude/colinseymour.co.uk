<p><img class="alignleft" src="/img/SmartStamps.gif" alt="Smart Stamp" />How cool is this?  You can now <a href="http://www.royalmail.com/portal/rm/jump3?catId=400043&mediaId=26800663">buy stamps from Royal Mail online and them print them directly</a> onto the envelope or a sticker instead of having to trek down to the local shop or post office.  Each stamp you print will be unique, machine readable and has an expiry date too. Unfortunately, for the traditionalist, it looks like they won't have the Queen's head on them anymore.</p>
