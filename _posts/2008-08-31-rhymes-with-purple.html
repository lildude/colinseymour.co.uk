<p>I'm sure you've all heard that "<em>no word in English rhymes with month, orange, silver, or purple</em>".</p>
<p>Well, I've found one that rhymes with purple, and it's courtesy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kerouac">Jack Kerouac</a> in chapter 2 of his novel Desolation Angels...</p>
<blockquote><p>... why ask questions or tear hair or weep, the <em>burple</em> blear purple Lear on his moor of woes ...</p></blockquote>
<p>There it is: burple.  Now I know Jack Kerouac isn't exactly on the same level as Dickens or Shakespeare and he was probably off his face when he wrote the book, but as it's in a book, by a famous author, it must be ;-)</p>
<p>A quick search on Google reveals there was a product in the 80's called a Burple (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burple">here</a> and <a href="http://www.inthe80s.com/toys/burple0.shtml">here</a>), though I suspect it was probably only available in the US.</p>
