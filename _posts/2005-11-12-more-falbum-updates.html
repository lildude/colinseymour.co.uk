<p>For some reason <a href="http://www.randombyte.net/blog/">Falbum</a> 0.5.3 was quite buggy, so I didn't actually update, I just updated my 0.5.2 installation to use the libcurl change I submitted and left it as is.</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks I've been furiously hacking the 0.5.3 code to try and fix the problems people are encountering and add some enhancements etc.  Well, tonight I finally got to a point where I was happy to feed back my changes.  I've summarised my changes <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/techie/falbum/#0.5.3-changes">here</a>. I haven't moved these changes to my main site <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/gallery/">gallery</a> just yet (but will do soon), but you can check out the final product on my test <a href="http://www.lildude.f2s.com/photos/">page</a>.</p>
<p>I also made a suggestion (details on the page above) about the way Falbum is distributed - too many people are expecting it to simply work with their themes without any effort from them.   Like any plugin that affects the design and layout of a page, this is an unrealistic expectation, and as such I have suggested this be changed.  </p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see if my changes and suggestions get implemented.</p>
