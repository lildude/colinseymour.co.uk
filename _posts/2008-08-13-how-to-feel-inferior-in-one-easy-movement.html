<p>Go to the gym, grind out 3 sets of 6 reps of deadlifts at 120kg and finish feeling amazing and like you've accomplished something good in your workout.  Then look up at the telly and see the women hoiking weights in excess of 120kg over their heads in the Olympic women's weightlifting competition.</p>
