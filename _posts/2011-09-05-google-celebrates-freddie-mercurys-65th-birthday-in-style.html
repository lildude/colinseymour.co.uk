<p>I think someone as Google is a huuuuge Freddie Mercury fan if today's animated doodle is anything to go by.  Had Freddie Mercury not left the building so early, he would be celebrating his 65th birthday today and Google have a great tribute to him.</p>
<p>If you're seeing this today, 5 September 2011, then head on over to <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">google.com</a>, crank up the volume and click on the doodle.  If you're not, or really couldn't be bothered to look somewhere else, here's the video on YouTube, assuming Google doesn't send itself a take down notice...</p>

<p>Very good, and a great musical interlude for the day.</p>
