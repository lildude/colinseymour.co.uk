<p>I've given it a week for peeps to pour over the Virgin Digital advert picture I <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/exercise-your-music-muscle">posted last week</a> and I think that's long enough.  If you don't want to know the answers just yet, stop reading now as all the answers and details are coming right up...</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Right, so you've got this far, you obviously want to see the answers.</p>
<p>First - where I got the picture - from Virgin Digital of course. Click the "See the Poster" link on <a href="http://virgindigital.com/eymm.htm">this</a> page.</p>
<p>How I verified the answers - on the <a href="http://www.virgindigital.com">Virgin Digital</a> main page, there is a <a href="http://www.heavy.com/heavy.php?channel=virginGame">link</a> in the bottom right hand corner where you can enter the competition to win an Alienware PC and 1 year's free music (US only :-().  The nice thing about this competition page is it tells you how many you got correct once you've submitted your answers. It was also this page that alerted me to the fact that there was an inch or two missing from the left hand side of the image I posted (which is the image from the Virgin Digital site).</p>
<p>Now, this site also posts the answers to the script that does the checking using GET, so a little bit of network snooping and I soon established that you can verify answers one at a time, without having to fill the form in by using the following URL - <a href="http://dev.heavy.com/contests/virgin/results.php?answer1=">http://dev.heavy.com/contests/virgin/results.php?answer1=</a> and simply append the answer you want to check, in lowercase after the "=". This will return <code>"num_correct=0&amp;answers=Array"</code> for an incorrect answer and <code>"num_correct=1&amp;answers=Array"</code> for a correct answer.</p>
<p>And now for the moment you've all been waiting for - the confirmed list of 74 correct answers:</p>

71. 311<br />
72. Jane's Addiction<br />
73. D12<br />
74. Go-Go's</p>
<p>Now this is the official list, however there are several other artists/bands that I can see depicted in the picture, however they're not the ones the game wants. </p>
<p>Note: If you're going to enter them into the competition, you need to make sure you use the same wording and punctuation - the capitialisation shouldn't be a problem, but capitilise exactly the same to be sure. </p>
<p>I've added notes to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lildude/70789372/">"glued" pic</a> in Flickr showing where all the artists/bands are.  The only ones that have a slight tenuous link are 311 and D12 - they're correct because they validate, however I had to do a bit of creative thinking for their location on the picture, so the location may be wrong.  </p>
<p>We'll have to wait for Virgin to release the actual answers to see how right I was with the locations.</p>
