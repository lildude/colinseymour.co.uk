<p>I'm working lates this week, and today is a glorious day cracking a cool 33C (as reported by my car).  Now whilst most other people are sitting enjoying a lovely cool beer and enjoying the warmth, I'm working.  Normally this isn't a problem, however some stupid arse decided it would be a good idea to dig through a gas mains in his JCB.  Now I'm in the DR centre without any air-con sweating my nuts off.  Viva global warming.</p>
