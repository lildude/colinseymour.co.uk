<p>Well, our neighbourhood has fallen victim to the gales howling through northern Europe these past few days.  Claire happened to look out the window today and noticed this:</p>

<p>We're lucky in that we've only got about a 3 inch wide strip missing, but our poor neighbour at the end, lost his garage door and his whole roof.  The wind kindly dumped the entire roof all over the train tracks, which from the look of things, wasn't noticed by the train driver and smashed to pieces.</p>
