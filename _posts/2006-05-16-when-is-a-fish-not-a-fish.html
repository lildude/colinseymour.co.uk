<p>Claire found this a while back and I've been meaning to post this for a while, but just haven't had the chance.</p>
<p>So, back to the the question - When is a fish not a fish?</p>
<p>When it's spelt <em><strong>ghoti</strong></em></p>
<p>Huh?? I hear you say, well let me explain...  gh as in "<em>tough</em>", o as in "<em>women</em>", and ti as in "<em>nation</em>". Simple really :-/ , but I think I'll stick with spelling it "<em>fish</em>"</p>
<p>You can read more on this crazy spelling reform topic in the <a href="https://alt-usage-english.org/excerpts/fxwhat04.html">original article</a>. </p>
