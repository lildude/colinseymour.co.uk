<p>South Africa's national braai day is coming up (24 September) and I thought I'd checkout <a href="http://www.braai.com" target="_blank">braai.com</a> to see what they're up to this year.  Well imagine my surprise when work blocked my access...</p>

<p>That's quite a tenuous link there, but I can understand the thinking... a braai is a barbecue...  at a BBQ you "roast" meat... sometimes on a spit...</p>
