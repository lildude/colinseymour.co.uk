<p>If you're currently in the south of England, sitting in front of your computer, reading this then step away from the keyboard and go outside and enjoy the lovely clear blue skies. Thanks to volcanic ash and some gorgeous weather, we're currently experiencing the emptiest skies you're ever likely to see over the UK. No clouds. No contrails. Just crystal clear blue skies. Amazing.</p>
