<p>Following our <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/blog/global-warming-shmarming/">snowfall on Saturday night</a>, a couple of kids built a snowman on the grass across the road from us.  Well, it's now Thursday and we've had 3 days of glorious sun shine and remnants of our neighbourhood snowman are still there...</p>

<p>He's lost his head, and his stature is a bit diminished, but he's not giving in... he just will not die like all other snowmen. He's a real fighter.</p>
