<p>I've decided to stop posting about technical subjects on this blog.  I think I caused far too many people to glaze over, so now this blog will be exactly as it is now, except all the techie stuff that interests me will be posted on my tech blog at <a href="http://www.lildude.co.uk">http://www.lildude.co.uk</a> instead.</p>
<p>At the moment, I'll keep whatever techie stuff there is here, but will slowly start moving it over as soon as I've come up with an effective way of redirecting people to the new location of these posts.</p>
