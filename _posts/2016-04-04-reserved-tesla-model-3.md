I've been a long time fan of the [Tesla Model S](https://www.teslamotors.com/en_GB/models?redirect=no) and love the whole idea behind Tesla's retail model and company philosophy but there was no way I could justify stumping up so much money for a car.  Yes, it's an amazing car, but waaaay too expensive for me.

Not anymore.  The [Model 3](https://www.teslamotors.com/en_GB/model3) looks good and sounds like it's going to be a great car so I've done it; I've stumped up my Â£1000 refundable reservation fee and reserved myself a Model 3.  Delivery isn't expected until late 2017 and given the number of orders mentioned by Elon Musk on Twitter, I suspect it may only be sometime in 2018 that I'll get mine so there's plenty of time to save up for it.

**Update**: I've just received my confirmation...

Soooo excited.
