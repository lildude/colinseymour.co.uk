<p>Before heading over to France to play a bit of French club rugby (and relinquish his chances of being selected for the Boks for a while), Francois Steyn built himself quite a reputation for being a big kicker who could easily slot the ball between the opposition's posts from within his own half, but check out this drop goal, it's amazing...</p>

<p>At a guess I'd say he easily had an extra 20 to 30m on that kick so a 90m kick is certainly in sight for Francois.  Lets just hope he returns to South Africa before <a href="http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/">September next year</a> or <a href="http://www.sarugby.net/">SARU</a> relax their selection criteria.</p>
