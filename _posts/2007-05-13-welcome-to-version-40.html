<p>If you're seeing this, then the move across to my <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=57232&U=214347&M=10198">new hosting company</a> was a success.</p>
<p>Welcome to version 4.0 of my website.  As you can see we're sporting a lovely red, white and purple look with a flexible content area (it gets bigger and smaller as you resize your browser) with a "floating sidebar". Let me know what you think.  The only thing I'm not sure about is the logo I created.  I'm not sure if it fits in with the rest of the look of the new design.</p>
<p>As I always do, a screenshot of how things used to look:</p>
