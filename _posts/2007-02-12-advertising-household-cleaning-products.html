<p><img class="alignright" src="/img/cillit.jpg" alt="Cillit Bang" />I was pondering a bit last night, after watching another "Hi, I'm Barry Scott..." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cillit_Bang">Cillit Bang</a> (also called Easy-Off Bang in other other parts of the world) advert: Who exactly are these people aiming their marketing at?</p>
<p>For as long as I've been alive, I have <strong>NEVER EVER</strong> lived in a house that has anything anywhere near as disgustingly dirty as the loo's and surfaces depicted in these adverts.  What kind of slob lets their loo, kitchen counters or stove top get into that state?  Surely those that do, aren't interested in Cillit Bang, else they would have discovered it or another cleaning product and a little bit of elbow grease years ago.</p>
<p>Granted, I don't think the adverts would be really interesting and exciting (how exciting can a cleaning product advert really be?) if they demonstrated on average household dirt and limescale.</p>
