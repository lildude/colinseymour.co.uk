<p>Your buddy asks you to look after his dog for a weekend. No probs, but why not take full advantage of it?  That's exactly what Capetonian, Dave Meinert, did when he looked after a mate's dog and he took full advantage of his temporary furry friend: he created this really good music video for <a href="https://www.myspace.com/johnnyneon" target="_blank">Johnny Neon</a>...</p>

Great video filmed from a dog's perspective, even if they have edited out some of the common antics dogs get up to on a daily basis, especially when meeting other dogs ;-)</p>
