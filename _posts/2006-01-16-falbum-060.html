<p><a href="https://www.randombyte.net/blog/2006/01/16/falbum-060/">Falbum 0.6.0</a> is out now with a few fixes and significant changes.  The biggest of which is the change to all the code being in a class - which means you will need to include Falbum on your front page and initialise a new instance in order to get recent and random images working on non-album pages.  When I've got more time, I'll write up an implementation guide.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I won't be migrating to 0.6.0 just yet due to one major bug, the privacy options don't work, so anyone can view images marked as private.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Found and logged the <a href="https://www.randombyte.net/bugs/view.php?id=12">bug</a> that was causing privacy to not work.</p>
