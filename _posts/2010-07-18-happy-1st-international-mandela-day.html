<p>Yes folks, today, 18 July 2010, is the first international <a href="http://www.mandeladay.com/">Mandela Day</a> to mark the contribution of Nelson Mandela to world freedom.  South Africa has celebrated Mandela Day for while, but <a href="http://en.mandeladay.com/News/18-july-proclamed-the-international-mandela-day-by-the-un-id=211.aspx">last year the UN gave it a thumbs</a> up on the international calendar.  What would have been brilliant is if the UN had made it a mandatory bank holiday too.</p>
