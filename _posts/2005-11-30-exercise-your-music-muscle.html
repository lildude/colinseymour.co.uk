<p>Check out this cool picture - it's a new advert of sorts (Part of some "<a href="https://virgindigital.com/eymm.htm">exercise of your music muscle</a>" idea) from <a href="https://virgindigital.com/">Virgin Digital</a>.  Apparently there are <strike>75</strike> 74 bands/artists represented in the image.  </p>
<p>How many can you spot?</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I've just realised the image is missing about an inch from the left. <a href="https://static.flickr.com/18/70789372_638bd34761_o.jpg">Here's</a> the picture with this extra inch "glued on".</p>
