<p>Another random odd thought crossed my mind... I wonder how Pope John Paul II is currently feeling.  He's either feeling very smug about his preachings or absolutely devastated. I can just picture a row of Bhudists in front of a re-incarnated (Pope) John Paul with big smug "I told you so" looks on their faces.</p>
