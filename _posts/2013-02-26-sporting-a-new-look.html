<p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the new look <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk">colinseymour.co.uk</a>. If you're reading this via a feed reader you really don't know what you're missing, but to whet your appetite, here's a little snippet...</p>

<p>Sexy hey? Wait until you see it on your tablet, phone or retina display MacBook Pro (I hope - no one has donated a MBP to me for me to actually test)... this site should look just as sexy there too.</p>
<p>So why the new look? Well, I've been sporting the <a href="https://colinseymour.co.uk/welcome-to-my-new-lighter-and-brighter-look">old theme</a> for nearly 2 years now and I was starting to get a bit bored of it. I also wanted to update my theme to one that better supports my new way of blogging - macroblogging - and also the plethora of devices we use these days to access the internet. It also had to be quick loading (got some backend code changes coming soon which should make it even quicker to load).</p>
<p>"Macroblogging?" I heard you say a moment ago. Yup. The idea behind macroblogging is everything happens here, on my blog, first and then it appears on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ etc with links back here, with a few exceptions. This way you only really need to follow me in one location, but more importantly, my content is on my server first. If Twitter or Facebook or Google suddenly disappears or drops into insignificance, I don't lose my stuff and I don't have to waste time exporting and importing the content I want to save.</p>
<p>Now this isn't a new idea... it's been around for a while and in fact my motivation to do this actually comes from a <a href="https://dropsafe.crypticide.com/article/5514" target="_blank">post</a> I bookmarked from an ex-Sun engineer when he switched to this way of things in January last year, with his more refined "<a href="https://dropsafe.crypticide.com/article/5895" target="_blank">manifesto</a>" written about a month later.  This is what I'm aiming for.</p>
<p>So there you have it folks, my new look and my new way of keeping in touch with the world. I've got a few more tweaks to make, but if you spot a problem, let me know, else enjoy.  Oh and if you have a spare retina display MacBook Pro that you would like to permanently donate to a worthy cause, I've got a free space on my desk for it :-D</p>
