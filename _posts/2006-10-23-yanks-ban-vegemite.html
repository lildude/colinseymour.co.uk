<p>The US have decided that <a href="https://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,20620744-953,00.html">expat Aussies can't have Vegemite in the US</a> anymore because it contains folate (ie folic acid) and the only things that can have folate added to them in the US are bread and cereals.</p>
<p>I think this is rich coming from a nation with soooo many preservatives and other GM junk (high fructose corn syrup) in their everyday food.  I find it strange that the US is quite happy to allow and require folate to be added to bread and cereals, but won't allow it added to the spread that gets smeared on top. They've banned it like it's some deadly or controlled substance. </p>
<p>So, to all Aussies: when you next go for a jolly to the US, remember to leave the Vegemite at home.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I've just checked our jar of Marmite and it's got folic acid in it. Folic acid is the synthetic form of folate, so there's a good chance the US will ban this too. I guess the Brits, New Zealanders and Saffers can't have Marmite in the US either.</p>
