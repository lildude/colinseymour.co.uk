<p>Here's a little challenge for you.  Take a good look at the picture below (click it to open the full size image)...</p>
<figure class="center"><img src="https://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/BlinkingReflection/977065457_64oLM-M.jpg" alt="977065457" title="Blinking Reflection" width="338" height="450" /><br />

<p>Notice something odd?  Look at the boy's eyes.  They're closed in the main part of the picture but open in the reflection on the TV.  Apparently this picture has not been Photoshopped or manipulated in any way, so how can this happen?  How can the boy's eyes be open and closed in the same picture?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: For those who are still interested and still haven't worked it out, it's due a method some modern digital cameras use to capture an image.  Instead of using a single shot that captures the whole scene, the camera uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_shutter" target="_blank">rolling shutter</a> to capture the image.</p>
