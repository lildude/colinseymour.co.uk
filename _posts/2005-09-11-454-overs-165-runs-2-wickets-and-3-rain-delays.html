The Ashes series has been fantastic this year with England repeatedly out playing Australia.  As a result, cricket has gathered quite a following from the usually football crazy English population.  England went into this final match 2-1 up in the series of 5 games playing for a draw at the least in order to win the Ashes. The Aussies have to win to retain the Ashes.</p>
<p>Alan and I were lucky enought to go and watch the 3rd day of the final Ashes match between Australia and England at The Oval.  Alan managed to obtain 2 tickets from one of his work colleagues (who we joined for the day) way before the series started.</p>
<p>Things started well, in that we both got to the ground and into it with plenty time to spare, but things didn't last.  Play was delayed by 30 minutes due to a heavy downpour that occured at about 10am.  Eventually play got underway, but not for long... about 7 overs later the heavens opened and the cover came out.</p>
<p>I won't go into all the details as the BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/4232120.stm">details</a> the day's play nicely, but we got wet a couple of times, got to watch a 45.4 overs, 165 runs and 2 wickets worth of cricket, drink beer and all in all have a good day out.  </p>
<p>It would have been better if we had a full day's play with loads of sunshine, but I suppose we can't have the Ashes and the good weather ;-)</p>
