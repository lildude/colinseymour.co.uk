<p>A New Year's Message; South African style (thanks Steve & <a href="http://www.cherryflava.com/">Cherryflava</a>)...</p>
<p>May good luck stalk you and happiness attack you wherever you go<br />
May your worries be hijacked and all negativity be robbed from you<br />
May peace break into your house and may thieves come to steal your debts<br />
May the pockets of your jeans become a magnet for notes of large denominations<br />
May the problems you had, forget your home address!</p>
<p>Eish. Heppy New Year</p>
