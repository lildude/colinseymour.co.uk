<p>English rugby officials have been left red-faced following the leak of a pre-recorded Nike advert which hails England for winning the Six Nations Grand Slam.  Except, England were trounced by Ireland 24-8 so England didn't win the Grand Slam. Ooops.</p>
<p>Now if ever you need a story to go with a few old clich√©s - Don't count your chickens before they hatch - and - Pride comes before a fall - then here is it. Enjoy.</p>

<p>I hope Nike haven't made an advert commemorating England winning this year's world cup yet :-)</p>
