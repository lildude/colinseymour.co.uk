19:00 GMT marks the start of the <a href="https://cricketworldcup.indya.com/">ICC World Cup Cricket 2007</a>. Woohooo!!!  Come on South Africa, oh and England (my second team - they have to be really, as I do use this country for my own benefit). How do you think your team will do? If you're not sure, or don't know who to support, I recommend South Africa (naturally), but if you're not convinced, maybe the <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/6379701.stm">BBC's form guide</a> may be of some use.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to watch most of it as I've not <del datetime="2007-03-12T16:32:38+00:00">surcome (have I spelt this correctly?)</del> succumbed (I found the correct spelling) to the temptation of getting Sky - it's probably a bit brash getting it just for the cricket and rugby world cups - or is it?  With that in mind, does anyone know of a site that will be streaming the cricket for free? If not, I guess I'm either going to be having some very late nights, or waking up at crack of sparrow farts as the Beeb has highlights at really insane hours - 2315-0015 and then repeated at 0500-0600.</p>
