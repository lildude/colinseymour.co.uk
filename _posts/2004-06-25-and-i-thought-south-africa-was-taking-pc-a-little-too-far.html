<p>Whilst on holiday in SA last year, I heard a song by the Black Eyed Peas called "Lets get Retarded" or somesuch. It's an odd title for a song, but it's a catchy song.</p>
<p>Well, about 6 months later this same song was released in the UK, but unfortunately, things are so PC (polically correct) that they've released the radio edit and titled it "Lets get it started" and then chopped the song to make "retarded" sound like "started"... it sounds more like "sshhtarded"</p>
<p><strong>[Update:]</strong> Seem's like the song has now been re-recorded to say "started" so no more editing required.</p>
