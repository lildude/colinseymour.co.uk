<p>I really think the future posting feature of Wordpress is cool.  Thanks to it, I can tell you that at the time this post is published, I am flying over Africa on my way to my well deserved break in sunny South Africa.  Well, I'm hoping it's nice and sunny.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I was tempting fate with this post.  Air France decided to let our flight to SA go before our flight from London actually got to Paris. So we had to spend 24 hours in Paris - fun.</p>
