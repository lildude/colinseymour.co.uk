<p>Looks like the first white kid to be given the name Winston since Winston Churchill has just been <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7682446.stm">born by Billie Piper</a>.  </p>
<p>I've been suggesting people name their first born son Winston for some time now, but sadly no one has taken up the suggestion.  The closest we've got is the teddy bear Claire and I gave Elizabeth. I think I can stop asking people now safe in the knowledge there is finally another white Winston - Winston James Fox.</p>
