<p>Went onto Google today and noticed ...</p>
<p><img class="center" alt="Google Doodle for my birthday" src="/assets/Google-Doodle-for-me.png" width="611" height="306" /></p>
<p>... they changed the doodle just for me to say "Happy Birthday". Nice touch Google.</p>
<p>On a side note, today is the first time it's snowed on my birthday in the country I'm in at the time.  Pretty cool (and cold) for a kid from Africa :-D</p>
