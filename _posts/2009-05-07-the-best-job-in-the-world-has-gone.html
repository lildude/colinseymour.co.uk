<p><a href="https://www.islandreefjob.com">The best job in the world</a> has <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8035168.stm">gone</a> (to a <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=chugger">chugger</a> from the UK) and I missed it.  I didn't even know it was being advertised.  Oh well, maybe next time - it is only a 6 month placement after all.</p>
<p>If like me, you know nothing about "<a href="https://www.islandreefjob.com">The best job in the world</a>", here is a summary of the job:</p>
<p><strong>Job Title:</strong> Caretaker of the Islands of the Great Barrier Reef<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Hamilton Island, Great Barrier Reef, just off the coast of Queensland, Australia<br />
<strong>Responsibilities:</strong> write a blog, take photos, make videos, snorkel, feed the fish, pick up the mail and clean the pool.<br />
<strong>Term:</strong> 6 month contract<br />
<strong>Remuneration:</strong> A$150 000 (Â£73,500; $110,000)<br />
<strong>Other benefits:</strong> Return airfares from your nearest capital city (in your home country), accommodation (three bedroom beach home with swimming pool and golf cart) and transport on Hamilton Island, travel insurance for the contract period, computer, internet, digital video and stills cameras access, plus travel to a number of the other Islands of the Great Barrier Reef.</p>
<p>I think they're right when they call this the best job in the world: you're getting paid to have a holiday in probably one of the most beautiful places in the world.</p>
<p>I wonder if my boss will let me have 6 months off for the next period, assuming they re-advertise. I'm sure Claire would love this secondment.</p>
