<p><img class="alignright" alt="Big Ben Election Results Mockup" src="/img/BigBenResultsMockup.jpg" width="226" height="240" />Tomorrow is the big day: <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/default.stm">election day</a> in the UK and tomorrow evening is likely to be the most exciting (as exciting as watching people talk about numbers and politics can be) election night in a long time, especially if the media's predictions of a hung parliament are anything to go by.</p>
<p>To add to the excitement and suspense, the BBC will, for the first time, <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8656578.stm">project the results of the election on to the side of St Stephen's Tower</a>, which houses Big Ben, from the moment the first results come in until about 5:30am on Friday morning.  The number of seats won by the three largest Westminster parties will be updated as the results come in.</p>
<p>Sadly, there are some <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/england/8614196.stm">killjoys out there who won't be continuing in the tradition of counting the votes on the night</a> but they're few and far between so the result projected should give everyone a good idea of the final outcome come 5:30am.</p>
<p>I don't think I'll watch the official TV coverage as I think <a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/channel-4s-alternative-election-night">Channel 4's Alternative Election Night</a> coverage may be a better watch, but I'll certainly be keeping an eye out on the results with the occasional peek at Big Ben (via the BBC - I can't see Big Ben from the edge of Reading) just to see how well this will work and also to satiate my curiosity on the outcome.</p>
<p>Thanks to the beauty of the postal vote system I've already cast my vote.</p>
