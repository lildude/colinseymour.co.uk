<p>A colleague was browsing for loans on a popular price comparison website, MoneySupermarket.com, and happened to spot the following two CRAZY deals:</p>
<p><a href="/img/badloans.jpg" class="thickbox"><img class="center" src="/img/badloans.jpg" alt="Bad Loan Rates" title="Bad Loan Rates - click for full size" width="500px" /></a></p>
<p>Who in their right mind is going to pay over 60% APR, let alone nearly 200%, when the lowest available is just 6.3% ?!</p>
<p>I know it's hard for some people to get credit, but here's a bit of advice: if you can't get one of the top 5-10 in this list, you probably shouldn't be getting a loan in the first place.</p>
