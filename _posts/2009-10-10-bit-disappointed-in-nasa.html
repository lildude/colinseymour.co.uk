<p>I can't help but feel a bit disappointed in NASA. When I heard they were firing two rockets at the moon, with the full intentions of actually crashing them right into the moon, two pictures came to mind...</p>
<ol>
<li>A great big Hollywood style explosion with all the oooos and aaaahs we've come to expect from anything involving crashes from that side of the pond and ...</li>
<li>The full after effect of the "bigger and better culture" we've come to expect from the US. I was anticipating they'd over-cook it and blow a hole right through the moon. OK I exaggerate a bit but I was expecting an "Oh shit" moment when someone realised that they only needed a cardboard box-sized amount of explosives and not a whole car's worth.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sadly, and potentially thankfully (the aliens won't be too cross with us humans) we didn't get any of what I colourfully imagined and instead all we got was a bit of a damp squib with <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/space/article6868687.ece">nothing really to see</a>. How disappointing.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if the relatively cheap cost of $79 million was worth it though.</p>
