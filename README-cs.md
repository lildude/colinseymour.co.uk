# BarefootRunner.co.uk

This is the source repository for [barefootrunner.co.uk](http://barefootrunner.co.uk).

This is really of no interest to anyone other than me and is for the moment a scratchpad documenting my migration of this site from Habari to Jekyll and then possibly on to GitHub Pages.

## How I did it
- Forked the [Habari Export](https://github.com/habari-extras/export) plugin and enhanced it so that it produced a more consistent and up-to-date WordPress compatible WXR file.
- Exported my site to a WXR file using my modified version of the [Export plugin](https://github.com/lildude/export)
- Created a basic Jekyll site
- Created a git repository for the site
- Dabbled and got a basic theme working
- Cloned the [Wordpress.com Jekyll import plugin](http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/wordpressdotcom/) to [lildude/jekyll-import](https://github.com/lildude/jekyll-import) and modified it to:
  - set absolute pathnames for all images
  - not output frontmatter that is not set or that I'm not interested in
  - take a domain option so I can limit where I download images from
  - handle protocol-less images
  - URI encode image paths
- Created a new branch for the import: `git checkout -b import`
- Add the following to .gitignore:

  ```
  import.xml
  import.rb
  ```

  These are temporary and are only there for the time of the import as they make the import much easier.

- Commit the .gitignore changes
- Added the following to the Gemfile in the branch:

  ```
  gem "jekyll-import", path: "/path/to/my/local/jekyll-import"
  gem "sequel"
  gem "hpricot"
  ```

- Ran `bundle install` to install all the gems
- Copied my exported WXR file to the root of the blog as `import.xml`
- Created the following ruby script to perform the import:

  ```
  require "jekyll-import"

  JekyllImport::Importers::WordpressDotCom.run({
    "domain" => "colinseymour.co.uk"
    "source" => "import.xml",
    "no_fetch_images" => false,
    "assets_folder" => "assets"
  })
  ```

- Import all posts: `bundle exec ruby import.rb`
- Commit _posts and assets: `git add _posts assets && git commit -am 'Added posts and assets'`
- Copy all posts in `_links` to `_posts` and changed the post type and layout in the process using:
  ```
  for x in `ls -1 _links/`; do
  sed -e 's/type: link/type: post/' -e 's/layout: link/layout: post/' _links/$x > _posts/$x
  done
  ```

- Create individual directories for each of the files in `_pages` and copied the files to `[pagename]/index.html` - because I like pretty URLs without `.html`
  ```
  for x in `ls -1 _pages/`; do
  dir=`echo $x | cut -d- -f4- | cut -d. -f1`
  mkdir $dir
  mv _pages/$x $dir/index.html
  done
  ```

- Create `_drafts` and move all draft posts from `_posts` to `_drafts`:

  ```
  mkdir _drafts
  for x in `grep -l "published: false" _posts/*`; do
  new=`echo $x | sed -e 's:_posts/[0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}-::g'`
  mv $x _drafts/$new
  done
  ```

- Set `published` to true for all drafts as my theme will only display "published" posts when I use `jekyll server --drafts`:

  ```
  for x in `ls -1 _drafts/`; do
  sed -i '' 's/published: false/published: true/' _drafts/$x
  done
  ```

- Download all assets and move them to `assets/` effectively flattening the directory structure
- Update all posts that still refer to old assets which my [lildude/jekyll-import](https://github.com/lildude/jekyll-import) plugin has missed

  ```
  cd _posts
  sed -i.bak -E 's:http\://colinseymour.co.uk/user/files/([0-9]{4}/)?([0-9]{2}/)?:/assets/:g' *
  ```

- Update all links back to myself that use the old format to use the new URL format:

  ```
  cd _posts
  sed -i.bak -E 's:http\://colinseymour.co.uk/([0-9]{4}/)([0-9]{2}/):/:g' *
  ```

## How I deploy to my own server

- Add a new remote that is on my hosting server:
  `git add remote deploy user@hosting.srv`
- Add the following `post-receive` hook to it:

  ```
  #!/bin/sh
  PUBLIC_WWW=${HOME}/www/colinseymour
  rm -rf ${PUBLIC_WWW}/*
  git archive gh-pages | tar -x -C ${PUBLIC_WWW}
  exit
  ```
- deploy using: `git push deploy gh-pages --force`

## Todos

- [x] Remove fields from the frontmatter of each post that I don't use (categories, meta, author, status)
- [ ] Customize & optimize the theme
- [ ] Switch out all emoticons for emoji
- [ ] MAYBE: Use an [emoji font](http://emojisymbols.com/) for emojis instead of local or GitHub hosted
  - [ ] TODO: If I do the above, I need to convert the jemoji plugin to insert unicode chars for each of the :emoji: references
- [x] Set absolute image paths - they're all relative assets/[filename] which works on the front page, but not the individual posts page
- [ ] Check each individual post & page and make they all render correctly.
- [x] Update Export plugin to grab all content types, not just posts and pages
- [x] Add alignleft, alignright and center CSS for imgs
- [ ] Convert as much HTML to markdown as possible.
- [ ] Catch all changed URLs with the [Jekyll Redirect From plugin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from/)
- [x] Add a sitemap.xml - using the code from http://davidensinger.com/2013/11/building-a-better-sitemap-xml-with-jekyll/
- [x] Add Google Analytics
- [x] Add Google Adsense
- [x] Add Google Webmaster tools header
- [x] Get date into frontmatter else it's anyone's guess when the posts were originally created.
- [x] Add a Rakefile and borrow some of the ideas from Octopress
  - [x] Create new post
  - [x] Publish draft post
  - [ ] Stash posts
- [ ] Mark draft posts when running with `--drafts` so I can easily distinguish them.
- [ ] MAYBE: Add fontawesome icons to posts in archives to distinguish types.
- [ ] Use local copies of remote assets when running locally
- [x] Determine a better method of detecting locally run than the current site.debug method I'm using - Found it: `JEKYLL_ENV=local jekyll server --watch` and then use `jekyll.environment == 'local'` wherever you need the conditional. Jekyll 2.1 intro'd this support.
- [x] Pre-process locally and save minified content to a branch.  This makes the repo larger, but quicker to deploy.
- [x] Add robots.txt
- [ ] Switch to native liquid HTML compression and use built in Jekyll functionality for CSS & JS compression.
- [ ] Put compressed CSS into header
- [x] Use Reduce to just minimize/optimise images that change.
- [ ] Put page specific CSS into its own file that is only loaded on that page, eg Calculators
