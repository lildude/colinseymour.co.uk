<p>So Sainsbury's has kicked off their third Great British Beer Hunt and are offering a great range of beers you're probably never had before for Â£1.50 a bottle. I discovered this last night so picked up 8 beers I've never had before. There are more, but I'll go back for those.</p>
<p>One of the beers I picked up was the Black Pepper Ale from Batemans. I didn't realise what I was getting into when I bought this; I just thought the shelf-edge description sounded interesting.</p>
<p>Tonight I drank that beer, and what an novel idea. The beer is a bit of a so-so malty ale that comes with a small satchet of cracked black pepper. Unfortunately no instructions. So I hit Untapd to see what others had done and it seems you sprinkle the pepper into the beer.</p>
<p>I did this with a small sample and tasted it and believe it out not, it actually works. It's like taking a swig of malty beer just after eating a piece of boerewors or biltong. However I thought it was missing something: the lemony nose you get from freshly ground black pepper. So on my next sample I cracked my own peeper on top. Much better.</p>
<p>So if you see this beer in Sainsbury's and fancy giving it a try, bin the satchet of proper that comes with the bottle and grind your own on top.</p>
