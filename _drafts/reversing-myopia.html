<p>Claire forwarded me a very interesting article about reversing myopia without surgery or lenses or anything.  All it ended is to actually train you eyes like you would you body.</p>
<p>Being one to try things to improve myself, I thought I'd give it a go starting today, 19 Aug, and see how I get on.  The idea is to spend most of my working day without my specs on or contact lenses in and see if I notice any improvements over a month or two.</p>
<p>One thing is for certain, I do think there's something in this... this morning I was contact free until I needed to go out for my run. I put in my contact lenses and instantly found it hard to read my laptop screen.  Seeing far with the lenses was fine,but close up was really hard work.</p>
