<p>After my mammoth battle with a certain company over their appalling customer service (<a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/my-worst-online-shopping-experience-courtesy-of-foo-bar-pty-inc">1</a>, <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/the-foo-bar-pty-inc-saga-continues">2</a>, <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/foo-bar-pty-incs-bad-customer-service-update-2">3</a>, <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/my-order-has-finally-shipped">4</a>), I went out of my way to put together, what I believe, to be a very <a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/customer-service-tips-for-an-online-business">useful and helpful post</a> designed to help them improve their business and the experience for their other customers.    I identified several shortcomings in their procedures and offered good solutions with the intention of at least receiving a written apology and maybe even thanks for identifying some problems and coming up with some valid solutions, rather than just have a winge that is often the case these days.</p>
<p>Sadly, this wasn't interpreted as such as I received the following email on 22 December 2009:</p>

<p>It is interesting that my position within Google is mentioned, and it's primarily why I'm writing this post, though I doubt it's what drove them to write to me.  </p>
<p>This blog is by no means a popular one: I barely crack 400 unique visitors a day, however my first post in the long trail did rate well, very well in fact, for two of their company names, in various forms.</p>
<p>Now I can see how this may affect their business negatively as the post that trumps them in the search results is entitled '<a href="http://colinseymour.co.uk/my-worst-online-shopping-experience-courtesy-of-foo-bar-pty-inc">My Worst Online Shopping Experience Courtesy of "FooBar Pty Inc"</a>' and it's likely to be picked up very quickly by other dissatisfied customers - this is what I suspect triggered this email. However, this needn't have been the case.  A simple written apology acknowledging their mistakes and thanking me for my input would have warranted a post in itself.  If the letter had been well worded and carefully thought out, I would have included it in the post for everyone to see, linked to the post from all the others and given the post high priority for maximum exposure. They would then have kept one customer and probably attracted a lot more. Sadly, that never materialised but instead this email.</p>
<p>What I find particularly appalling about this email is it's using the power and might of a company against a lowly individual in a very aggressive, and quite vague manner.  I don't have the time, money or inclination to see something as fickle as this go to court, so I've appeased the situation by removing all reference to the company name, (I now reference a completely fictitious company - "FooBar Pty Inc"), their products and employee names.</p>
<p>I don't know how everyone else thinks, but I know I'd certainly have a lot more confidence in a company that actually put its hands up when they have made a mistake, apologised, made amends and left the customer happy, so happy in fact that the customer is happy to advertise the fact to the world as I intended on doing. Maybe I'm unique here, but I doubt it.</p>
