<p>After two weeks, we got to really know and appreciate the villa and can say it fulfilled everything we could expect of it and then some.  We do however have a few suggestions for improvement: it needs rugs.  It's so big, especially the living room, that it echoes and echoes a lot.   A few rugs would help dampen the echoes and make conversation easier.  Given the good weather we didn't spend much time indoors anyway.  The TV also needs the Spanish channels.  The villa has a great big satellite dish and a Sky box tuned to pick up as many of the the free-to-air satellite channels from the UK as possible, but no aerial so none of the local channels could be picked up.  Watching a bit of local telly is a great way to tune your ear into the language in preparation of what you'll be encountering out and about.</p>
<p>I'm also quite surprised at just how much spanish I do remember.  I can't speak it too well, but I can certainly understand a fair bit, and this part of Spain speaks much slower and clearer than in Madrid, so it was easier to grasp too.</p>
