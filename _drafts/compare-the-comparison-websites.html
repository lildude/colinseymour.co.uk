<p>Everyone knows that when looking for car and home insurance one of the easiest things to do is pick one of the comparison websites, enter your details and then select the cheapest policy.  I normally do this, but today, as I had a bit of time on my hands, I thought I'd see if I could compare the comparison websites.</p>
<p>Well, check this out.  I entered exactly the same information into Compare the Market, Confused.com and Go Compare and checkout the different quotes I got if I followed the links to the QuoteMeHappy.com site.</p>
<p>QuoteMeHappy was the cheapest for me that included legal cover and fully comprehensive European travel as no additional cost.</p>
<p>Does it pay to use the comparison websites?  Most definitely, but keep in mind each comparison website will be doing their own deal with the insurers so it pays to shop around the comparison websites too.</p>
