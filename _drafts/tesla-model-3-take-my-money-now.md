On [4 April 2016 I put my name into the Tesla Model 3 order queue](https://colinseymour.co.uk/reserved-tesla-model-3) and have been patiently waiting for my turn to order. Sadly, this isn't going to be until late next year at the earliest as right-hand drive versions aren't due to ship until 2019 at the earliest ðŸ˜­.

This morning I stumbled upon this video on Twitter and I want Tesla to hurry up and take my money even more now.
