<p>My first 30 day challenge is now complete and I can report it was a resounding success...</p>
<p>[ Screenshot of calendar from Garmin ]</p>
<p>Not only did I manage to run at least 3km every single day for 30 days, I also racked up the most kilometers in a single month that I can actually recall every doing... a whopping 2xxkm.  I don't think I ran this far in a single month back in my prime as a kid in South Africa.</p>
<p>So onto my next 30 day challenge.</p>
<p>[ Decide which of these to do:<br />
- take a single photo a day using my 50mm prime lens<br />
- don't drink shop bought beer. Only home brew and pub bought<br />
- drink a different bottle of beer every day for 30 days<br />
- don't consume sugar<br />
- watch only 2 hours of TV a day at the most  (stops me watching TV for the sake of it)</p>
