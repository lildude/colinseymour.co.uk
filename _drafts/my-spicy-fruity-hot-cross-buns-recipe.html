<p>For the buns:</p>
<p>450g strong white bread flour<br />
150g of mixed dried fruit (raisins, sultanas, currants and candied peel)<br />
7g dried activated yeast<br />
3 tsp of mixed spice<br />
1 tsp salt<br />
1 rind of one orange (munch the fruit when you're done)<br />
1 egg<br />
200ml milk<br />
100g of golden castor sugar<br />
100g of unsalted butter</p>
<p>For the crosses:</p>
<p>75g flour<br />
4 tsp caster sugar<br />
4 tbsp water</p>
<p>For the glaze:</p>
<p>1 tbsp brown sugar,<br />
2 tbsp milk,<br />
1 tbsp marmalade </p>
<p>Method:</p>
<p>Dough:</p>
<p>Sift flour, salt and spices into a large bowl and mix in the yeast, fruit, rind and sugar.<br />
Warm the butter and milk together in a saucepan until the butter has melted. Remove from the heat and whisk in the egg and add to the flour mix. Mix and knead dough on a floured surface for 10min until smooth and elastic.<br />
Place into a greased bowl, cover (with cling film) and leave in a warm place to prove and double in size.</p>
<p>Split into 12 equal sized buns and place on a greased baking tray<br />
Cover and leave in a warm place to rise for about 30 mins</p>
<p>Crosses:</p>
<p>Mix ingredients for form a thick paste.  Transfer to freezer bag with the corner cut off or piping bag and pipe crosses onto the buns once they've risen.</p>
<p>Bake in pre-warmed oven at 200 degrees Celsius (400 degrees Fahrenheit) for about 20 minutes - they should be golden brown and a skewer should come out clean.</p>
<p>Glaze:</p>
<p>Mix ingredients and boil until a syrup forms.</p>
<p>Glaze your buns the moment they come out of the oven and then leave to cool.</p>
<p>Munch.</p>
<p>I made my crosses a little too runny and the hole just a little too big.</p>
