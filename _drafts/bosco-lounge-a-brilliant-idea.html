<p>The person who came up with the idea of putting Bosco Lounge in Woodley, and the town councillor who approved it are geniuses. Every time I've been in or past, at various times of day, the place has been well populated. I think it's done a great job at drawing people back to Woodley high street, and who knows, maybe we'll get more restaurants and better shops soon.</p>
