<p>Ever browsed the shelves in the wine and spirits department of your local supermarket and wondered how the likes of Sainsbury's and Tescos can sell own-brand South African, Australian and Chilean wine for such incredibly low prices, especially considering how much tax and duty we pay on each bottle?  Ever wondered what the quality will be like, thought about the impact on the origin country's wine economy or thought about how genuine the wine is? I have on many occasions and it seems I'm not the only one.  It looks like the South African government is waking up to this and starting to make waves.</p>
<p>First a little background.  The way supermarkets do this is they import the wine into the UK or EU in bulk.  They then bottle, possibly with a little blending, and label the wine and distribute it to their supermarkets for resale as wine of the country the bulk wine was sourced.  They do the bulk importing under the guise that it is more environmentally friendly than importing the pre-bottled wines.  I agree, this part is probably true to a certain extent as a big vat of wine will take up less space and weigh less than the equivalent volume in individual bottles.  However what importing in bulk also does is bring down the cost which is much more important to the retailers.</p>
<p>Now many a Brit is always happy to get their hands on a bottle or two of cheap booze with very little concern for the source and the impact the low price has on the source.  Add in the fact it's cheaper because it's "greener" and you're onto a winner.</p>

<p>, even better, but what everyone else forgets is the impact on the source.  If that wine is particularly bad, the source country gets labelled as "making crap wines" and if it is particularly good, the </p>
<p>Many a time I've browsed the wine shelves in our local supermarkets and marvelled at the incredibly cheap South African (and other) wine for sale under supermarket own-brand labels and wondered how they could be doing this and what impact it would be having on the countries they're importing the wine from.  </p>
<p>Coming from South Africa, I'm quite a fan of the wine from back home and I've always been doubtful of the origin of wine claiming to be South African if it doesn't have a "Wine of Origin" or "Sustainable Wine South Africa" label - the two tell-tale signs that the wine has really come bottled from South Africa.  After a bit of research and having read several articles I'm right to be concerned.  What happens in these cases is the supermarkets, or some other distributor, is bulk importing large amounts of wine and then bottling it in the UK under the guise of it being more environmentally friendly than importing bottles.  It also happens to be cheaper which is, no doubt, the primary reason for doing it.  </p>
<p>It also has the advantage for the superma</p>
