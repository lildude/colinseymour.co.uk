<p>After posting my post about butter being good for you, my cousin commented on facebook with:</p>
<p>I made this to amuse myself the other day...</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/gNulT.jpg" alt="Simon's Weight Loss" width="960" height="720" /></p>
<p>The book referenced is <a href="ttp://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B007KZS5OQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B007KZS5OQ&linkCode=as2&tag=colsey-21" target="_blank">Tim's Noake's Challenging Beliefs: Memoirs of a Career</a>. I've read this book too and one of the topics covered is Tim's experience with a high-fat diet.  As the author of <a href="ttp://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0873229592/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0873229592&linkCode=as2&tag=costest-21" target="_blank">Lore of Running</a> - a veritable tomb of running information, which includes a large section on how a high-carb diet is essential for runners, Tim has stepped up, put his hand up and said he got it wrong.  He's even been quoted as suggesting people tear this section of the book out and throw it away.</p>
<p>Anyway, I started my quest on a low-carb diet after discovering that a skin condition I have was more aggravated after eating high-carb meals, sweets and a combination of the two - hmmmmm, donuts (Krispy Kreme of course).  At the time I was reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1616080655/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1616080655&linkCode=as2&tag=colsey-21" target="_blank">Phil Maffetone's The Big Book of Endurance Training and Racing</a> in which he details the benefits of a low-carb diet for endurance athletes.  As I'd decided I'd like to try his training methods, and given my experience with my skin condition, I thought, what the heck. Lets give is a try.  I did some research and discovered a paleo diet is a good and sensible low-carb  diet and I actually found <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/" target="_blank">Mark's Daily Apple</a> to be a great source of information.  You could say I adopted a "primal lifestyle" rather than a paleo diet - some hardcore paleo peeps would deem Mark's primal diet "paleo-lite".  I don't care, I just wanted a low-carb diet to try and it sounded good to me.</p>
<p>Well within a few weeks I noticed my skin was much better behaved, I felt great, my running (now training using Phil Maffetone's heart rate based training idea) was improving and I was actually losing weight.</p>
<p>Anyway, I responded to Simon with:</p>
<p>Nice going. I didn't weigh myself nearly as frequently, but I can say I saw pretty much the same thing. I dropped from 78kg on 26 Mar to 73kg on 20 Jul by quite closely following a paleo style diet using information from a combination of Tim's Changing Beliefs Book, Phil Maffetone's The Big Book of Endurance Training and Racing (I do all my training based on Phil's ideas at the moment) and the info on Mark's Daily Apple (.com). Phil's book got me started, Tim's bolstered Phil's ideas and Mark's Daily Apple provided all the paleo inspiration and answers I needed. My running volume increased during that time too, but not enough to singularly be responsible for the weight loss. Previous increases in mileage whilst on a low-fat diet didn't bring with it the weight loss. I also feel great on the high-fat diet. I run faster, recover quicker and definitely enjoy running again like I used to back in high school. It's become very clear to me that the high-carb diet is not for me. Carbs made me fat (98kg at my peak) and fat has made me thin again :-) I don't think I'll ever go back to that way of eating.</p>
<p>Simon's response:</p>
<p>I record weight in my training diary which is why I had the data. What this doesn't show is that my weight remained stable from January to April, despite running 7 marathons and an ultra. Then, I read Tim's book while I had bronchitis and yet got down to 80kg in two weeks, without being able to run. Been doing only about 40km a week but my 10k time has dropped 4min in the same period. Couldn't be happier.</p>
<p>Now you might be thinking, "Come on, you're both runners, of course you're going to lose weight if you watch what you eat" and fair point, however that doesn't quite explain Simon's weight loss without actually doing much running.  It also doesn't explain how my wife, Claire, who has been humouring me and following the primal diet with me, has also lost weight - not a lot grant you, but she's not a fatty like me - and the nearest she comes to running is the bit round the block before she kicks it back under the bed ;-) </p>
