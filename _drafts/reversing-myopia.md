Claire forwarded a very interesting article to me a few months back about reversing myopia without surgery or lenses or anything.  All it entails is training you eyes like you would you body.  In this case, the "weight" is a plus lens, and the exercise is to practice close up reading with the plus lens instead of your.  It raises a very valid point: if we treated our spine like we do our eyes, we'd all be wearing braces.

Being one to try things to improve myself, I thought I'd give it a go starting today, 22 Feb 2016, and see how I get on.  The idea is to spend most of my working day without my specs on or contact lenses in and see if I notice any improvements over a month or two.

Day 1: 22 Feb 2016

I took my contact lenses out last night, as I try and remember to do every Sunday evening. Instead of putting them in first thing this morning, I went lens-free and cycled periods of close reading with the +1.0 glasses and not, with occasional focusing far into the distance. My near reading was on my iPad or computer screen and the far focus was on a TV aerial on the building across the road. When not looking at my screen or iPad, I didn't use any form of vision correction.

My first observation is it's tougher to read close up with the +1.00 lens than it is without them or my contact lenses.  This is expected as I have myopia and the +1.00 lens sort of inflicts an artificial form of hyperopia, ie far-sightedness. Forcing my eyes to adjust between this artificial hyperopia and normal vision definitely feels like exercise.

I stopped "exercising" at 11:30, worked for a bit without the glasses and my normal glasses or contact lenses and then put my contacts in at 11:40.  Wow!!! What a difference.  Wearing my contact lenses immediately felt like hard work and I found it really tough to focus on near objects, like my computer screen.  Looking into the distance was fine.

It took me about
