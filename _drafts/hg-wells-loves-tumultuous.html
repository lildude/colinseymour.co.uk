<p>I finished reading <a href="http://amzn.to/GCv0e1" target="_blank">The War of the Worlds by HG Wells</a> last night and I must say, for a book first published in 1898, this guy had incredible foresight and an amazing imagination.  Pity it didn't extend to his use of the word "tumultuous".  I've never seen a book with quite so many uses of the word.  That said, he does have a way with adjectives which is quite refreshing compared to many modern writers.</p>
