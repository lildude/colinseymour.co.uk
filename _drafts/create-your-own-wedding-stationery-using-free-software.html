<p>Well, the big day have come and gone and it was fantastic.  Nothing went wrong and everyone looked lovely, but no where near as lovely as Claire.  One thing that was evident was how impressed everyone was with our wedding stationery, so I thought I'd show the world what I did and what tools I did it with.  In summary, EVERYTHING was done on my Mac using open source (aka free) software and software supplied with the OS. I also tried to keep things relatively consistent.</p>
<p>Save the Date:</p>
<p>[img here - save to png]</p>
<p>Used Inkscape to create the image and layout.<br />
Saved to PDF<br />
Printed on sheets of card bought from shop in wokingham (need to get name) an then cut down to size.</p>
<p>Invitations:</p>
<p>[img here - take photo of invite standing and one lying down]</p>
<p>We cheated a bit here.  All the paper, card etc came from Confetti<br />
Layout and wording was done in OpenOffice, actually the Mac variant NeoOffice<br />
We created an in-lay and and additional info sheet.<br />
Envelopes printed with mail merge in OpenOffice/NeoOffice</p>
<p>Evening Invitations:</p>
<p>Paper from Confetti<br />
Layout and wording as Invite in-lay, and done in OpenOffice/NeoOffice, but on a single piece of paper instead of two.  We didn't use the brown folders for the evening invites.<br />
Envelopes printed with mail merge in OpenOffice/NeoOffice</p>
<p>Table Numbers:</p>
<p>[img here - save to png or take pic of]</p>
<p>Use image and layout from Save the date cards in Inkscape, but changed font to <a href="http://www.dafont.com/renaissance.font">Renaissance</a><br />
Used thick card, but folded in half for extra rigidity</p>
<p>Name Cards:</p>
<p>[img here - take picture]</p>
<p>I actually did these in Inkscape as the font I used (<a href="http://www.dafont.com/renaissance.font">Renaissance</a>) kept getting chopped off at the top in NeoOffice.</p>
<p>I used plain card, printed in 6x2 layout with cutting guides and then cut to size with craft knife. Used the back of a butter knife to indent the back to ease folding.</p>
<p>Table Plan:</p>
<p>[img here - save to png]</p>
<p>Same image from save the date and table numbers.  Due to font issue above, used Inkscape again. </p>
