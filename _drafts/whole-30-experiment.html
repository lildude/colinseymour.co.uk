<p>Claire and I have been following a low carb, high fat, paleo-esque lifestyle (it's not a diet) for several years now and after a rather bad and excessive July decided we'd get back on track and try out Whole 30.</p>
<p>We're doing the original Whole 30 which excluded potatoes.</p>

<p>Hard bits: </p>
<p>- no alchohol - we like the pub and I love beer<br />
- no cheese - claire loves cheese<br />
- finding things without added sugar - it's in almost anything packaged in some form or another</p>
<p>Easy bits:</p>
<p>- giving up grains - we've been grain free for years<br />
- eating fresh veg and meat</p>
<p>Observations:</p>
<p>- first 2 weeks easy<br />
- become very "dry"</p>
