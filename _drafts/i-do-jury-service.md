Several months ago I received my summons. Returned it with the prearranged date as it worked quite well for me... only time I knew I definitely want traveling.

## Day 1 - 8 June

Arrived at the Reading Crown Court just before 9am, showed my ID to "register" and was directed to the waiting lounge. The place was packed, mostly with older people. I think I may have been one of the youngest there.

After during in the lounge for 20 minds it became very clear the 9am start was a "start arriving from" time and not a "bee here by" time as loads more people came in later.

One person has a laptop so may consider bringing mine in tomorrow if I'm not on a case. There's BT WiFi so access to the outside world isn't a problem. Just need to check where I can lock it if I need to.

Finally started with the intro at 9:45 followed by a video bridle explaining what will happen. Apparently there are 6 hearings today, with 2 over in the magistrates court.

No onsite catering anymore. Only vending machines vending crap and going outside for lunch. Lunch is normally 13:00 to 14:00.

Lockers take £1 coins, which I don't have, and the vending machines don't give change either.

Can't claim a weekly bus pass either so my loss. Oh well.

Now we all just sit and wait. What a waste of time.

12:10 was called for court room 6. Released for lunch. Back for 2pm

For back and sat around. Apparently we're "on call" for jury selection where they'll pick 12 jurors from the 15 put on call ready for tomorrow, assuming it goes that far. Things like the defendant pleading guilty means no jury.  We'll see what happens.

15:40 called to front desk... and let loose for the day. Back for 10am tomorrow.

## Day 2

Back for 10am. Say around until 10:25 before being told there would be two hearings today and those who were selected for courts 1 and 6 would not be thrown back into the pool for drawing for these two cases today. I'm one of them.

12:05 fifteen named were called for court 1, excluding me, but told not to lock anything away which makes me think they're of for early lunch.

13:00 released for lunch to be back for 14:00

14:25 got called to reception... we're up. We've got a case.

We were escorted ↑ to court 6 sworn/affirmed in and given details is the charges and a summary of the offences by the prosecution. As it was so late in the day, no witnesses so we're key off at 15:30 to be back for 10:15 tomorrow.

## Day 3

I arrived a little early in town so enjoyed a coffee at Workhouse before heading to court. At 10:40 we were taken up to the court only to be told that one of the jurors has been released of his duties due to various concerns (we don't think he could read English or understand it very well) so the entire jury was released.

We went down stairs, sat about for 10 mins before they called a new group of 20 people - the remaining 11 jurors and 9 others on call - and took us up to the court for 12 to be selected at random. Random drew me first so I was back on the same case. Bad news was that we then had to listen to the prosecution's opening schpiel again.

It was then on to the prosecution's evidence until 12:55 when we adjourned for lunch.
