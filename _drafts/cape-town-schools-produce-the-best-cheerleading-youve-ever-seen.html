<p>Ever year, four schools in Cape Townâ€™s Northern Suburbs and outlying districts gather for a day of sporting and cultural competition. One of those contests is in school cheerleading. Known as the MTBS, the day sees DF Malan, Stellenberg, Tygerberg and Bellville highschools pitted against each other.</p>
